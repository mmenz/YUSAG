Adam Bisnowaty,OT," Well-built with proportional frame. Length is average, but his attention to arm extension helps make the most of it. Possesses good upper-body strength and his pass punch has some snap to it. Aggressively passes off twisting defensive ends to his guard. Does a good job of thumping at initial contact as run blocker. Rolls hips up under him after contact as a base blocker. Controlled climber to second level with a wide base. Wrestler in high school. Brawler with a mean streak. Able to exchange power for power if defender challenges him in a phone booth. Gets into his kick slide with good weight distribution.", Has missed time in each of his first three seasons with injuries to his ankle twice and back once. Limited bender with stiffness in his lower half. Unable to unlock hips and gain necessary ground in his pass sets. Lack of slide depth against speedy edge rushers forces him to open gate early and lunge. Appeared much more plodding in 2016 compared to his junior season. Struggles to change direction and unable to redirect weight back inside consistently enough to cut off inside moves. Able to get out into space but has a low connection percentage beyond line of scrimmage. Pad level way too high. Rarely able to get across the face of his opponent when zone blocking., Round 5, Daryl Williams," Four-year starter with plenty of toughness. Appeared to struggle with an athletic decline in 2016, which could be due to his injury history. In a phone booth, Bisnowaty can handle himself with pure brawn and power, but once he's forced to play in space, his athletic limitations become more pronounced. He'll likely have to move to the right side, but athletic opponents will always cause him problems. His ceiling could be as a low-end starter while his floor is fighting for a roster spot within a couple of years."
Bryan Cox Jr.,DE, Has experience playing with a hand down and standing up. Will surprise with how quickly he fires out of his stance. Possesses natural upper-body strength to set a strong edge and constrict his gap against the run. Physical-play demeanor will bear more fruit with improved hands. Can cave down offensive tackles who try and wall him off. Heavy tackler who doesn't seem to mind scrapping in tight quarters. Runs feet through his tackles. Not a content pass rusher and is constantly searching for an opening. His spin move has potential. Much more productive season in 2015 when he was fully healthy.," Upright attacker with limited knee bend and some hip stiffness. Sluggish lateral foot quickness and change of direction. Hand work needs to improve. Can be a little slow to punch, allowing defenders into his frame and minimizing his length. Aggressive with hands but needs more efficiency to his work. Doesn't create fear in tackles as rusher off the edge. Lacks cohesive rush plan. Put on skates when trying to corner the edge and can be run way past the arc.", Rounds 6-7,," While he has the functional athletic ability to operate as an outside linebacker in Florida's scheme, he is clearly best suited as a base end. Cox's length and power can become more effective combat weapons if he can be coached up on his hand usage. While he lacks the athletic traits and talent to become an effective pass rusher as a defensive end, his first step and rush skills could open a door for him as an interior rusher on third downs."
Larry Ogunjobi,DT, Low center of gravity with impressive power coursing through his hips. Wins race against blockers for first hands on opponent. Fires out of his stance and into blockers with coiled hips and a wallop in his punch. Strikes with leverage. Able to dislodge blockers with anchor issues. Plus athletic ability to mirror ball carrier once he locks in on target. Has speed to chase runners in space. Can set a strong edge or penetrate upfield. Makes impact tackles on the other side of the line. Hands are fast and powerful. Has strength and balance to fight through redirect blocks and maintain his journey to the quarterback. Uses powerful right-hand club to bat away blocker's punch and slide over the top and into the backfield. Constantly improving position as a pass rusher and can be a handful for a less-skilled pass protector. Pushes the pocket with his bull rush. Spends very little time on the ground. Intelligent; four straight years on Athletic Director's Honor Roll., Very average build for an interior player. Has continued to add weight while at Charlotte but likely needs a few more pounds. Below-average arm length makes it essential for him to get into blocker first. Will get big-boyed occasionally. Big guards with length able to disrupt his rhythm and alter his plans. Gets in a hurry when he smells a sack and will overrun target at times. Would benefit with more disciplined pursuit angles in space., Round 2-3, Sheldon Rankins," Watching Ogunjobi play is like watching a more raw version of Sheldon Rankins and with a little less efficiency of movement. Like Rankins, Ogunjabi uses leverage, quickness, and strong hands to counter his average size. Size and below-average length will work against him for some teams, but others who covet disruptive defensive tackles who can play in the backfield and generate some pressure will be studying him closely. Has starting NFL potential."
Reuben Foster,LB," Alpha mentality with ferocious hitting style that puts offensive skill positions on alert. Outstanding athlete with springy, reactive feet. Lost 15 pounds in off-season, which gave him more speed and explosiveness. Loose hips and long stride allows him to open and chase immediately. Has elite sideline-to-sideline range. Tough as nails. Brings swagger to a linebacking corps. Never passive and always means it. Willing to take his shots downhill and into gaps. Lands strong warning blows on climbing guards early in the game. Coverage ability is an asset. Logged 10 passes defensed in 2015. Can carry long speed against running backs on wheel routes and nine routes. Has worked to improve tackling technique, which has yielded higher success rate of finishes."," Instincts are just average. Overly reliant on speed and athleticism over instincts and feel. Can be a tick slow to respond to play-action. Inconsistent defeating blocks. Too eager to take on everyone at the point of attack. Gets shoulder covered up firing into incoming blockers. Needs to improve stack and shed technique to keep himself clean. Will drop his head at times as tackler. Poor tackling technique led to ""stinger"" issues early in his career.", Round 1, Bobby Wagner," Foster is a vicious hitter with elite playmaking range and an ability to toggle between 225 and 240 pounds. Athleticism gives him cover ability that former teammate Reggie Ragland never possessed. Has Pro Bowl potential as a 3-4 inside linebacker or a 4-3 weak-side linebacker, but concerns over his medical history could be a consideration, according to some teams."
Jon Heck,OT," Hulking tackle with long arms and legs. Massive frame allows him to envelop smaller edge rushers. When he’s able to get arm extension into opponents in his pass sets, they struggle to recover from it. Finds ways to block opponents. Plays under control and seems to understand his weaknesses. Play balance is adequate.", Knock-kneed. Slow and plodding in all his movements. Slow with low strike percentage against second-level linebackers. Doesn't take long for weight to shift too far outside in his pass slides. Uses narrow shuffle with feet too close together in pass pro. Hands are soft and sloppy. Leaky at his edge with inability to consistently redirect NFL talent. Pad level is poor and speed-to-power rushers are his nemesis., PFA,," Has the size and length that will immediately appeal to NFL teams, but is a right tackle only with a lack of functional athleticism. Athletic limitations and average overall talent could prevent him from becoming anything more than a back-end-of-the-roster type, but size gets drafted and size often sticks on rosters."
Dawuane Smoot,DE," Well-conditioned with willing motor to pursue across the field. Strong closing burst closes out quarterbacks in the pocket and running backs down the line of scrimmage. Acclaimed high school hurdler with plus agility, loose hips and nimble feet. Works to stay ahead of reach blocks and contain the edge. Able to knife through gaps and create disruption in backfield. Uses dip and rip when he senses he can turn the corner. Speed-to-power ability when given a runway. Good lateral quickness and would benefit from twisting scheme that allows him to operate in space. Able to redirect suddenly. Can play with hand in the ground or standing. Takes swipes at the ball; forced four fumbles over last two seasons at Illinois. Played for defensive guru Lovie Smith in 2016."," Needs to improve skill level and become more consistent with hands as a pass rusher. Average upfield burst to challenge the edge. Face-up rusher with issues cornering edge with snug turn. Rushes without much of a plan and relatively few counter attacks. Was swallowed up by North Carolina right tackle Jon Heck, an inferior athlete. Needs more sand in his pants. Struggles to set a hard edge and can be kicked out by quality tackles. Not enough wins against man-to-man matchups. Very small hands for the position.", Round 3-4, Anthony Chickillo," Duck-footed, face-up rusher able to generate some power in his rush, Smoot failed to put together the breakout season many predicted after a strong junior showing. He lacks a track record of pass rush production to excite NFL teams as an early round pick, but his athleticism could create an opportunity for him as a 3-4 rush end if given the chance."
Chidobe Awuzie,CB," Fluid, controlled steps with easy change of direction allows for extended mirroring from press. Decent jam to disrupt. Carries smooth backpedal downfield with excellent mirror-and-match footwork in man coverage. Digests route combinations from zone and makes wise choices. Athletic with suddenness in his movements. Springy feet allow for abrupt click and close to the throw. Opens and swivels hips for desired transition in all directions. Experienced outside and from slot. Able to maintain coverage on shifty slot receivers. Instinctive with feel for route development. Possesses short-area closing burst. Confident on an island. Finds receiver on deep balls and gets head turned around. Dangerous slot blitzer with seven sacks over final two seasons at Colorado."," Short strider. Appears to lack long, recovery speed if beaten over top. Feels smaller than his listed size. Can be handsy down the field with pulls and tugs that turn into flags as a pro. Managed just three interceptions in college. Run support is lacking. Could use more aggressiveness and commitment when stepping downhill to tackle. Passes on the big hit and allows tight ends and big receivers to power through tackle attempts.", Rounds 1-2, Prince Amukamara," Sticky man-cover corner who possesses the reactive athleticism and foot quickness to maintain coverage responsibilities around the field. Awuzie's combination of size and speed pairs well with his instincts providing him what he needs to compete downfield. His inconsistencies as a tackler could turn off some teams, but his abilities as a gunner on special teams may counter that. He can play outside or in the slot and has traits and talent to compete for early playing time."
Tim Williams,OLB," Muscle fibers are tight and twitchy. Rockets out of stance like a track sprinter, but with shoulder pads on. True edge bending ability as a rusher. Pass-rush approach is more sophisticated than he is given credit for. Can win outside or inside making every rush a potential two-way go. Shows good feel for the pass-rush arc and understands when to attack the corner. Able to dip shoulder and pivot under and around an offensive tackle and into the quarterback. Hand usage well-timed as a rusher. Primarily a rusher but showed continuing improvement in technique at the point of attack. Should post impressive straight-line speed at the combine. Plus foot quickness with the smoothness to drop into coverage and operate in space on zone blitzes.", Scouts say he struggles with Alabama scheme and needs to have things simplified. Can be taken advantage of with screen passes and misdirection. Has sinewy build that resembles a move tight end more than an NFL edge rusher. Arms and chest lack thickness and that shows up in his play strength. Is improving as edge-setter but he still needs work. Would benefit from a stronger initial punch. Athletic tackles with a well-timed punch can stymie his rush plans. Needs to do better job of getting set pre-snap. Has some hip tightness that limits his stride length upfield and laterally., Rounds 2-3, Leonard Floyd," Alabama has the type of talent and scheme on defense that can make life much easier for everyone along the front seven, but Williams has explosiveness and pass-rush talent to create his own havoc as a pass rusher regardless of what is around him. Scouts say he is lighter than his listed weight and needs to prove he can play with increased toughness in order to reach his potential. Williams' career might be as a pass-rush specialist, but he's talented enough at that endeavor to become a dangerous rush linebacker in the NFL."
Daeshon Hall,DE," Has experience at wide-9, 5-technique and as an outside linebacker. Frame filled out at a rapid rate over last few seasons at A&M.; Coaches believe he can add and sustain even more muscle. Has length and average quickness to dart into gaps and breach the flow of the play. Has tools to become better edge setter with more strength. One year of defensive line play makes him moldable for NFL coaches. Has decent bend-and-rip rush move. Has shown ability to get skinny and wedge between double-team blocks. Flexible upper body along with coordinated work between hands and feet suggest future improvements as interior rusher. Effort player who hustles his way into tackles.", Still learning to play lower and drop anchor at the point of attack. Will get bounced around and widened out of the gap by size. Needs weight work to supplement average contact balance. Washed down by redirect blocks too easily. Needs to become more commanding and authoritative with his hands. Pad level too high and too welcoming for opposing blockers. Appears to have lost a little foot quickness with addition of weight over final two college seasons. Needs to prove he has toughness to play as a 3-4 defensive end., Round 2, Jason Jones," Possesses the physical traits, versatility and effort to become an intriguing Day 2 selection, but teams might have to wait on Hall as he is still learning to play with a hand on the ground and needs to continue adding mass to his frame. Hall is nothing special as an edge rusher but has the talent to become an interesting interior rusher as a 3-4 defensive end. If he has enough ruggedness to handle full-time work in the trenches, he could become an eventual starter. The arrow is pointed up, but overdrafting the traits could prove to be a mistake."
Quincy Adeboyejo,WR," Height and speed are appealing. Operated outside and from the slot at Ole Miss. Has access to another gear. On go routes, uses basic head nods and jab steps to create hesitation in defensive backs before racing past them. Has been able to get over the top of most defenders he's faced. Coaches compliment his on-field intelligence. Three-time honor roll student off the field. Combination of quick feet and long strides provide opportunities for big catch-and-run plays on the next level.", Hands are inconsistent. Will try to cradle contested jump balls rather than snatching. Play strength is below par. Doesn't take much of a jam to redirect him in his routes. Has to learn to stack defensive backs and maintain position once he's on top of them vertically. Routes were mostly basic and lacking in technique. Ball tracking a work in progress. Lacks suddenness to operate as typical NFL slot receiver. Will need time to develop skill-set on next level., Rounds 6-7,," With a frame that should be able to add more muscle, Adeboyejo could be considered a Day 3 height-weight-speed flyer based on his ability to attack down the field. He is raw and is currently lacking the skill level needed to compete for NFL playing time, but has intriguing potential as a field stretcher or big vertical slot receiver."
Jonathan Allen,DE," Taken to school by Alabama coaching staff and is technically proficient in all phases. Plays outside and inside. Quick off the ball. Superior hand-grappler who can control the wrists and forearms of his opponents with accurate hand placement over wild chops and slaps. Varied approach as a pass rusher. Excellent athletic ability and possesses flexible hips. Able to coordinate hands, feet, and hips to climb over the edge against tackles. Has play strength and quickness to rip through the weak inside post of a guard. Can club with either hand to soften the edge of a blocker. Has posted consistent quarterback pressure and sack numbers despite playing in less than half of the defensive snaps. Alert against the run. Quick to diagnose the mesh point against zone reads and gives chase to the ball. Strong on the edge. Has speed down the line to close down back-side cuts. Feet never seem to stop. Vocal leader willing to give strong corrections to teammates in practice. Came to Alabama as an outside linebacker and runs like it when he's in the open field.", Lacking the height teams look for from defensive ends. Not very long and could struggle to win the race for hand positioning against long NFL tackles. Found himself engulfed by linemen with mass from time to time. A move inside could require more bulk on his bones. Not built to take on double-team blocks for a living. Doesn't possess lateral quickness and twitch to contain speedy running backs from getting the corner when he's at defensive end. Teams utilizing one-gap scheme could question his lack of tackles on other side of the line. Might have benefitted by playing along so much NFL talent up front., Round 1, Fletcher Cox," Outstanding leader and athlete with an ability to rush the passer from outside or inside. Has produced against the run and pass thanks to his strength, agility, elite hand usage, and plus footwork. He might not be the cleanest fit inside as a full-time tackle for some teams, but his talent should trump any size concerns. Allen is a likely first-round selection with Pro Bowl potential down the road."
Jaleel Johnson,DT, Has good foot quickness and a plus motor. Early bird into the neutral zone off the snap. Accelerates into blockers with forceful punch at point of attack. Maximizes his length. Uses one-arm jab and long-arm push to disengage from blockers and generate a bull rush. Loose hips and flexible upper body are play-making tools. Plays with good energy and gives you what he's got. Won't catch him leaning on blocks for a rest. Hands and feet are in constant concert to improve positioning and defeat run or pass blocks. Rushes with both effort and skill. Always working to the edge of a blocker with quick feet and violent hands. Change-of-direction talent creates difficulties for plodding guards. Had one of his finest games in upset over third-ranked Michigan., Too upright at point of attack. Narrow base and elevated pad level create issues for him against double teams. Might not have the anchor necessary to operate inside a two-gap scheme. Contact balance is below average. Unable to consistently fight back against a quality down block. Is a little soft around the middle and lacking thickness through arms. Limited number of tackles for loss. Can be a little slow to recognize screen passes., Round 3-4, Ziggy Hood," Active defensive tackle with the motor and athleticism to find production in the NFL. Johnson doesn't have the functional anchor that teams looking for a run-stuffer will be after. However, his effort, foot quickness and hand usage should create opportunities for him as a pass rusher. Johnson has the talent to become an eventual starter as a three-technique in a penetrating defensive front and could fight for rotational reps early on as a rookie."
Dalvin Tomlinson,DT," Good arm length with power in his large hands. Fires jarring punch into blockers quickly and is in control of the rep. Has good feel for double teams. Broad, powerful hips and strong post leg helps him drop anchor against down blocks. Awareness and power helps him constrict his gaps. Maintains two-gap responsibility until it's time to tackle. Doesn't linger on blocks long. Stacks and sheds with consistency. Locates ball quickly. Recognizes run-direction tendency from certain formations. Long, lateral step allows him to get head-start on blocker and prevent being reached. Quality motor and effort. Chases outside his area like he expects to make the play. Willing to do dirty work in Alabama's twisting defensive scheme. Does outstanding job of occupying both blockers on twists. Active hands in passing lane to bat down passes."," Only one season playing more than 45 percent of team's defensive snaps. Is surrounded by upper-echelon prospects, which eases attention on him. Slow-twitch defender who lacks quickness into neutral zone off the snap. Most pass-rush success comes via twists and games up front. Not a threat to beat interior pass protection with rush moves. Makes predictable pass-rush charges and doesn't garner enough pocket push as bull rusher.", Rounds 3-4, Dan Williams," Prototypical Alabama defensive tackle who wins with leverage, power and technique. Tomlinson's powerful frame and ability to stack the run between the tackles could make him a scheme-flexible target in the draft. While he is likely to be drafted as a run bully, his history of operating in Alabama's stunt-and-twist-oriented defense could help keep him on the field on third downs for teams using a similar concept. Tomlinson has a chance to become an early starter and should work into a defensive line rotation immediately."
Kendell Beckwith,ILB, Big throwback frame with ability to bang between the tackles. Has experience in the middle with both 3-4 and 4-3 schemes. Takes well-reasoned paths to the ball. Won't get caught rushing downhill without a plan. Will down into guards as pre-emptive strike before they combo up to him. Maintains his run fits and leverages his gap with an aggressive forearm shiver to short-pulling guards and isolation blockers. Hands are quick with some shock. Can unlock a surprising closing burst to close out on the perimeter. Eyes are disciplined. Good read and respond but plays the game with patience. Body control a plus. Won't always be pretty but he gets guys tackled. Awareness in space and overall football IQ is above average. Able to find receivers working through his coverage area. Reads quarterback's eyes helping him drift toward targets.," Inconsistent taking on second-level blocks. Is good with his hands but will default to run around or ""olé"" approaches at times. Athleticism and agility are very average. Could struggle playing sideline to sideline. Has some straight-line burst but takes awhile to unlock hips and chase to the sideline. Plays way too tall. High center of gravity slows his ability to redirect. Missed tackle total too high over last three years. Pad level hinders ability to break down in space and change direction to wrangle shifty running backs. Stiffness in space could spell doom if asked to cover backs out of the backfield. Torn ACL in bowl preparation will damage his stock.", Rounds 3-4, Benardrick McKinney," Productive full-time starter over last two and a half seasons on talented LSU defenses. Has the size and spirit to play for teams expecting physicality from their inside linebacker, but his game comes with some athletic and coverage limitations. Before his injury, he could have come off the board on Day 2, but may see his stock fall into the third day now. He has starter's ability when healthy."
Corey Davis,WR, Outstanding four-year production. Alpha attitude on the field and not afraid to take on the challenge of heavy target load. Excellent competitiveness. Focuses like a laser when ball is in the air. Tracks the deep ball as well as anyone in college and understands how to stack cornerbacks and keep them on his hip. Has second gear to run under the long ball. Excels in intermediate and deep parts of the field. Route running showed improvement in 2016. Variable route speed creates indecision for defenders. Vertical routes are crisp and create tilt in off-corners and safeties that he is quick to take advantage of. Play speed features access to functional burst. Can defeat inside leverage. A quarterback's friend who works aggressively back to the ball. Dominates in red zone. High-point catcher who uses well-timed leaps and long arms to win the 50-50 throws. Increases physicality and acceleration out of routes when operating near paydirt.," Doesn't always sell his vertical routes aggressively enough to make cornerbacks open their hips. Drifts, at times, on in-breaking routes, allowing defenders to squeeze the route. Needs to improve quickness into and out of his breaks underneath. Elongated into breaks when working from slot. Has had some issues with focus drops on throws outside of his frame. Had 16 drops over last three years at Western. Free releases into his routes in college will turn into stern press challenges in the pros. Wasn't asked to do much meaningful blocking.", Round 1, Eric Decker," Touchdown juggernaut who was a four-year model of production and consistency in college. Davis has the route-running and ball skills to become a starter in the league, but it is his competitiveness and production in the red-zone that should make him a good one."
Jon Toth,C," Four-year starter in competitive SEC. Good size and bulk. Understands his physical limitations and plays to his strengths. Fits into blocks with good body control and at a leveraged strike position. Unlocks hips at contact on down blocks to pin defender and present a running lane. Generates power from his lower half. Held his own against formidable Alabama defensive front. Utilizes efficient, compact punch. Has good hand strength to snatch and engage. Operates with plus hand placement, and willing to re-set hands to improve positioning when necessary. Able to control shoulder and steer opponent away from the hole. Good arm length for a center. Looks for work in pass protection and has enough anchor to thwart a bull rush."," Marginal athlete. Plays with heavy feet and below-average lateral quickness. Could struggle with sudden redirects inside to catch blitzers and twisters. Struggles to mirror athletic, interior rushers in pass pro. Labors to recover once beaten. Snap-to-step quickness is very average. Effectiveness wanes beyond line of scrimmage. Has some hip stiffness which causes him to rely on leaning over bending. A little slow in his climb to second level.", Rounds 6-7,," Toth is a tough, four-year starter. Will appeal to teams looking for centers who can operate in a power-based rushing scheme. While he's better in a phone booth than on the move, he understands his limitations and does a good job of staying within himself. He's not the best athlete at the position but his size, arm length, strength and consistency should outweigh that on the next level. Toth has the traits and ability to be an eventual starter in the NFL."
De'Angelo Henderson,RB," Has access to an accelerator that gets him around the corner or through the line of scrimmage quickly. Ran a verified 4.49 40 in early 2016. Runs bigger than his listed size. Unafraid to drop the pad level and get it on with would-be tackler. Powerful lower body with balanced base to maintain his feet despite a big hit from an angle. Willing worker between tackles. Runs through initial contact and makes tacklers work for it. Decisive runner. Low center of gravity with sudden, one-cut ability. Prolific at scoring touchdowns. At his best in space. Good pass catcher with long speed and open-field shiftiness to hit the big play out of the backfield. Able to adjust his body to poorly thrown balls. Adequate pass-protection skills.", Needs to develop better patience between the tackles. Appears to make decisions to grind forward a little too early at times. His creativity as a runner can be a little inconsistent. Has the feet to make defenders miss but doesn't always do it. Squared-up runner who lacks slipperiness to get through tight crevices. Needs work on consistency and technique in pass protection. Doesn't have size to continue taking on tacklers as often as he does at next level. Outstanding production came at lower level of competition., Round 6-7, Branden Oliver," Henderson is built low to the ground with the balance and power in his lower half to fight forward for additional yardage after contact. His courage, burst, and one-cut ability should appeal to zone-scheme teams while his pass catching and willingness to block gives him a chance to compete for a role on third downs. Henderson had prolific production throughout high school and college and plays with the mindset and confidence of a future pro. He's undersized but has the skill to compete for a spot on an NFL roster right away."
Ryan Glasgow,DT," Former walk-on with hard-hat demeanor. Willing fighter in trenches and refuses to give blockers a snap off. From football family. Big brother, Graham, starred at Michigan and now plays for Lions. Muscular and rugged with no bad weight on his frame. Has power in his upper body and uses a powerful club move along with a pull-and-shuck technique to get rid of blockers. Technician as interior run defender. Plays with wide base and good balance. Shows feel for double teams and braces quickly against them. Powerful, heavy tackler. Has arm length and power to lock out blockers in a two-gap scheme. Has strength to force his way past redirect blocks. Comes from a competitive family background and has excelled beyond expectations."," Could use more pure mass in lower body to withstand double teams inside. True NFL power across from him could limit his effectiveness. Not a natural knee bender, which limits his athletic movements in tight quarters and as a pass rusher. Square-shoulder playing style will limit his ability to disrupt at NFL level. Lacks pass-rush talent and skill set. Needs more violence and activity from his hands as a rusher. Unlikely to be on the field on third downs as a pro.", Round 5-6, Matt Ioannidis," Ryan Glasgow has helped to give Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh a level of toughness and dependability in the middle which has helped propel the Wolverines defense. He wants in on the action at all times and is at his best when he's able to play the man in front of him rather than having to get involved with Michigan's constantly twisting defensive front. Glasgow's rock 'em, sock 'em approach should appeal to defensive line coaches looking for high effort depth along their defensive front, but his inability to rush at an NFL level means he's unlikely to be more than a two-down player which could slide him to Day 3."
Connor Harris,ILB, Voracious appetite for tape. Elite tackle production. Tremendous leadership traits. Instinctive with immediate response to keys. Can race ahead of linemen. Has instant stop/start quickness and change of direction ability. Always attacking downhill. Looks to attack blockers early to disrupt the timing of the run play. Played quarterback and safety in high school and has the quickness in space to cover running backs out of backfield. Gym rat with good power throughout his tightly muscled frame. Burst to the ball puts him in position to make plays. Body-up tackler who finishes what he starts. Can play all three downs., Somewhat stubby frame with a lack of length. Unable to keep linemen off of him with punch and shed. Will get engulfed if he sits and waits. Straight-line attacker missing some fluidity of motion to consistently match the flow of a play. Square shouldered and unable to work body around blocks and through some crevices. Scouts question whether his production can hold up against elevated level of competition. Quicker than fast., Round 5-6, Chris Borland," Rock 'em, sock 'em linebacker with an inextinguishable motor and the instant quickness and burst to thrust himself into tackle after tackle. Harris is a willing chance-taker who fires downhill and into creases looking to make the impact play, but his lack of length and straight-line style of play could limit his effectiveness on the next level. With his instincts, quickness and nose for the ball as a tackler, Harris should find a spot on the linebacker depth chart and has a chance to be a kick-coverage winner."
Ryan Anderson,OLB," Thick through shoulders and chest with good upper-body power. Exhibits professional approach on the field. Disciplined and married to his assignments. Stays clean. Comes into the league with NFL-caliber hand work. Ready hands at point of attack with a willingness to stick and move to avoid being swallowed by size. Sets a sturdy edge and makes a point to physically challenge tight ends early in the game. Will ""dead arm"" inside shoulder to alter blocker's balance and sneak around the outside hand. Relentless charge as a pass rusher and gets home thanks to his effort. Leverages runners to the sideline and rarely gives up a cut-back lane. Tackle finisher who is always hustling. Plays teammate ball over hero ball. Has experience at outside linebacker in both 3-4 and 4-3. Forced five fumbles over last two seasons."," Relatively average athlete for the position. Lacks desired pursuit speed and closing burst as a 4-3 linebacker. Hips are a little stiff and he lacks plus range of motion. Could struggle with cover skills in space. Short arms could become an issue if asked to stack the edge against NFL tackles. Effort rusher missing desired traits found in consistent NFL pass rushers. His edge rush is more elongated and gradual than tight and sharp. Gets punched by tackles while shoulders are still square, causing him to flatten out as a rusher.", Rounds 3-4, Ahmad Brooks," Well-schooled with a high football IQ and a history as a winner. His disciplined, assignment-based approach to the game should resonate with defensive coordinators. Lack of length and average athletic traits could put a cap on his draft stock, but he should be a safe pick and a long-time starter as an outside linebacker."
Jarrad Davis,LB," Angular build with long limbs and a shredded physique. Excellent flexibility throughout his trunk. Can twist and turn to slither into gaps. Plus acceleration to chase all over the field. Scouts say coaches are effusive in their praise of his leadership, work ethic and character. Can be rude to company. Erupts from coiled hips with a jarring pop under the pads of oncoming blockers. Runs downhill with choppy steps in balanced, tackle-ready position. Effective in spy role with athleticism to mirror mobile quarterbacks. Has closing burst that could become a weapon as a blitzer. Wrap-up tackler with strong finishing rate. Improved his discipline pursuing to the sideline. Did a better job of leveraging running backs against the boundary. Forceful redirect of tight ends out of their routes. Good peripheral helps him spot crossing routes without having to drop eyes from the quarterback. Has athletic tools to become better in coverage."," Downhill routes to the ball can be problematic. Will step too far downhill and get trapped in traffic on counters or bounces to the perimeter. Needs to play with more consistent technique and positioning to properly leverage his gaps against gap plays. Lateral scrapes sometimes lack patience forcing him to overrun run fits and open cutback lanes. Sometimes prioritizes attacking blockers too high. Has to get better at seeing and working past the blocker and toward the runner rather than issuing so many physical challenges that get him behind in pursuit. Could improve with greater stick-and-move hand work to keep himself clean. Struggles to free himself when snatched by blocker. Average instincts create inefficiency with early, post-snap movement.", Rounds 1-2, Shaq Thompson," Praised for both his football and personal character, Davis has athletic gifts to go along with the character traits teams are looking for. His ability to cover ground, operate with loose hips in space, and finish his tackles make him a draft favorite for some teams. While it is easy to fall in love with the traits and potential, Will have to take better routes to the ball and learn to keep himself clean against blocks. Should be able to compete for an early starting job as a 4-3 outside backer."
O.J. Howard,TE, Exceptionally gifted athlete. Has long arms and massive hands for his position. Tremendous acceleration into his routes. Has tools to torment defenses on second and third level. Play speed resembles a wide receiver's when the ball is in the air. Linebackers have no shot against him in space. Can turn a short throw into a long gain. Light on his feet and smooth out of his breaks. Easy separator who creates instant throwing windows when he hits the gas. Natural pass catcher who plucks it away from his body. Can adjust to poorly thrown balls and secure contested catches. Shows no lack of toughness over the middle. Can be lined up all over the field. Monster championship game in 2015 season revealed true potential. Has elite ceiling as playmaker. Lands his hands inside the frame as a blocker. Operates with wide base and attempts to snap hips into his block., Will need more muscle and mass to be an in-line blocker as a pro. Appears passive. Doesn't have the field demeanor of most Alabama players. Needs better hand strength to sustain his blocks. Can do better job of working feet into position after contact. Needs urgency in his routes to tilt defenders and get them guessing. Needs to show more elusiveness after the catch. Saw playing time diminish from junior to senior season. Explosive talent who doesn't make enough explosive plays. Scheme creates some wide-open deep-ball catches at time. Scouts question his competitive nature., Round 1, Julius Thomas," Howard has struggled to live up to hype that has come with his play-making ability while at Alabama, but some scouts put the blame on the staff and scheme. He has elite athletic traits and raw talent, but must add polish to go along with those attributes. Should become substantially more productive as a pro, but the difference between ""potential weapon"" and ""elite tight end"" will likely be tied to his desire and overall football character."
Dorian Johnson,OG," Solid athlete when asked to play in space. Plays with leg drive as run blocker. Uses choppy, accelerated feet into contact and keeps chopping them through contact to secure the block. Operates with quality balance and limited waist-bending. Has the arm length of a tackle. Understands his job on each play. Has an accurate radar in seeking out second-level targets and connecting at a high percentage. Excels on short pulls with smooth lateral footwork and solid, squared contact. Keeps hands inside and will punch and re-set hands when necessary. Sets up with good base and anchor in pass pro."," Is a little inconsistent with smoothness coming out of his stance. At times too aggressive when he moves up to second level and will climb beyond his target. Needs to improve patience on his climb to create more consistency with his angles. Needs to let hands go more quickly in run game. Punches and pushes target with authority but doesn't snatch the framework and lock in, allowing active defenders to spin and squirm out of his blocks.", Round 2-3, Jack Mewhort," Five-star prospect coming out of high school, Johnson was a full-time starter for three years at Pitt and was known for his consistency and well-rounded game. He has functional power to turn defenders out of the hole and enough athleticism to match any run-game scheme. Johnson doesn't carry bad weight and should be able to add more bulk with no problem. While he has some weaknesses, nothing appears to be glaring and he should set into a starter's role right away and become a solid NFL guard."
Evan Engram,TE," Good explosion over the first 5 yards of his route. Plus athletic ability with easy-opening hips. Nimble feet with quick, controlled strides into and out of his breaks. Accelerates out of his breaks to uncover from defenders for quarterback. Will have to be guarded by defensive backs. Opens quickly to find the ball. Successful working all three levels at Ole Miss. Has true vertical speed to attack the seams. Competitive, athletic runner after the catch. Springy leaper. Jumped out of the gym to snare a touchdown over the head of a Georgia defender. Able to pluck balls low, high, and behind him.", Needs to learn when and where to sit down in the middle of the field. Must learn to do a better job of working back to the ball. Doesn't post up defenders effectively. Allows defender to work through him and disrupt the catch. Has had issues with drops and contested catches could be an issue. Allows throws to beat him up at times. Needs to do better job of selling a two-way go to the top of his routes rather than giving route direction away. Move tight end only who lacks dependability as a blocker., Round2 1-2, Jordan Reed, Makes up for his lack of size with athletic ability and plus speed for the position. Engram has experience as a safety blanket for Ole Miss QB Chad Kelly and can work all three levels of the field. He will appeal strictly to teams looking for a move tight end who can be deployed as a chess piece in a matchup-based passing attack. Engram's ability to stress defenses could land him on Day 2 (Rounds 2-3) of the draft and a potential starting role early in his career.
Jake Butt,TE, Has NFL size and steps up big in the passing game. Strong hands are like magnets. Can snatch and secure at the catch point. Tough and reliable when working in traffic. Fearless in the middle of the field and understands how to protect himself and the ball while there. Slick with hands. Has slap move to free himself off line of scrimmage and able to create separation at top of his route with sly push-offs. Sinks into space and chews up zone coverage. Play attributes will help him win in the red zone. Effective in intermediate work adjusting routes according to defensive positioning. Competitive after catch with ability to add to his yardage through force. Team co-captain., A little cumbersome getting off the line and into his routes. Very average athleticism. One-speed runner without many gears. Lacks speed to threaten vertically. Upright into and out of his breaks. Acceleration out of his cuts can be slight. Separation often comes from rub routes and scheme. NFL linebackers should be able to stick him in coverage. Limited catch radius. Grabby as a blocker and takes questionable angles up to second level. Allows physical outside linebackers to set strong edges against him. Needs more commitment and work as a run-blocker on NFL level.,, Zach Miller," In-line tight end with strong, natural hands and the toughness to make a living in the middle of the field as a chain-moving safety blanket. While he's shown ability to operate as an intermediate target as well, he might lack the athleticism and separation to uncover against NFL safeties and some linebackers in man coverage. Butt must improve greatly as a blocker to reach his potential as a Y tight end. However, his ability as a reliable, productive target should earn him an early starter's nod with a chance to become a solid pro."
Isaac Rochell,DT, Named team captain as a senior. Dependable and durable. Played in over 83 percent of team's defensive snaps over his last three seasons. Experienced pass rusher in T/E and E/T twist games up front. Has some bull-rush capability if his pad level is right. Gets good arm extension after contact. Has upper body strength to jolt blocker with his violent hands. Comes off ball with good bend and aggressiveness. Not easily out-leveraged against run blockers. Has enough natural power and anchor to play 5-technique in the pros. Length and upper body strength help his ground at point of attack. Shows ability to restrict his gap against the run. Tackle finisher when he gets to it.," One-speed pass rusher with very limited juice upfield. Despite high snap counts over final three seasons, produced minimal sack totals. Effort rusher with dull, predictable approach at times. Too content after initial rush thwarted. Fails to activate skilled counter rushes. Will present ""tweener"" concerns between defensive end and defensive tackle positions. Might be 2-gap only. Fails to see blockers in front of him. Gets too bogged down with oncoming collisions rather than stacking, shedding and making the tackles. Heavy punch needs to be followed with quicker disengagement. Low number of early wins at point of attack.", Rounds 6-7, Lawrence Guy," Lunch-pail player from a blue-collar background whose effort and motor will make him a favorite of coaches he plays for. What Rochell offers in effort, he lacks as a skilled pass rusher, and his inability to get after the quarterback will create a difficult challenge for him. While his best fit might be a 3-4 defensive end, he could be viewed as rotational defensive lineman with little to no third-down value. Rochell has third-day draft value with eventual starter potential if he can sharpen his pass-rush tools."
Corey Clement,RB," Carved-up beach body with impressive definition throughout. Has athletic ability NFL teams desire from the position. Utilizes explosive, sudden jump-cut to bound like a deer from gap to gap. Combination of lower body power and balance through contact allows him to run through weak tackle attempts. Able to elude defenders who bolt into the backfield. Lateral quickness and speed to the edge appear to be in order. Looks most comfortable as an outside runner. Sinks hips for sharper one-cut approach on outside zone plays. Able to string jump-cuts together to slalom around multiple tacklers from first to second level. Has shown enough speed in open field to hit the home run during his career."," Scouts have labeled him ""entitled"" and question his football character and leadership. Had 2015 season washed away due to injury, attitude and an off-field incident. One speed, monotonous approach as a runner. Lacks burst and drags feet through hole, allowing defenders to get hands on him. Impatient. Runs up the back of blockers rather than allowing plays to develop. Missing improvisational talent and finesse. Not an instinctive runner and lacks feel for development of running lanes between the tackles. Can be indecisive and very impatient. Seems to be waiting for the next jump-cut rather than punching the gas downhill. Can be hit-or-miss with his reads on outside zone plays. Rarely in on obvious passing downs.", Rounds 6-7, Peyton Barber," Clement's lack of durability combined with a lack of value as a third down option could hurt his draft stock, but negative feedback from inside the program could be just as big at this point. Clement has the size and athletic ability that will help him land on a depth chart, but he appears to lack the fluidity, decisiveness, and vision needed to become a dependable, productive starting running back. His best fit might be as a ""committee back"" in a one-cut running scheme."
Chris Wormley,DE," Well-built, thick frame from head to toe. Natural bender with ease of movement and agility for a man his size. Has experience playing inside and outside. Comes out low and aggressively off snap. Able to generate bullrush with speed-to-power drive into tackles. Hints of arm-over and spin moves as rusher. Good technician at point of attack. Sets strong, decisive edge with leverage, arm extension and anchor. Pursuit speed gives him extended tackle radius. Able to close down the line quickly and restrict cutback lanes. Balance is excellent; rarely seen on the ground. Able to plow through redirect blocks when charging through gaps. Fairly disciplined in approach. Aware and reactive to jet sweeps and counters. Student of the game and a willing leader.", Not very twitchy firing out of stance and up the field. Lacks explosion in first two steps as edge rusher. Shows delayed transition into the rush off play fakes. Needs to play with faster hands as pass rusher. His wins vs. blockers tend to be more eventual than sudden. Remains engaged with blockers longer than desired at times. Pursuit effort can run a little bit hot and cold. Could lack anchor necessary for full-time transition inside. NFL offensive linemen will be better equipped to counter Wormley's brute power. Needs to bring feet with him and through the tackle., Round 2, Jared Crick," Three-year starter who brings leadership and high character into the locker room. Wormley's size and athleticism could appeal to teams that favor big, strong base ends who can set a physical edge and then bump inside as pass rushers. Wormley could be coaxed into a more sophisticated pass-rush approach with coaching, but he's not there yet. His size, athleticism and versatility gives him a chance to earn early playing time and to become an eventual starter."
Zay Jones,WR," All-time FBS receptions leader. Hands catcher outside the hashes and snatches it away from his frame. Swallows ball into his frame to protect it when working over the middle. Tape shows a willingness to run head-first into traffic and make the tough catch when hit is imminent. Can win all day when it comes to finishing catches at the high point. Extremely driven to succeed. Plays with good focus and footwork on catches near the sideline. Has experience working from outside and the slot. Returned kicks as a junior. Has posted impressive numbers in Pirates' strength-and-conditioning program. Well respected in the program and scouts rave about his character. Father, Robert, was a Super Bowl winner with Dallas Cowboys.", Play speed is very average. Lacks vertical push to force cornerbacks to open and run early and doesn't have second gear to separate from coverage down the field. Thin frame. Struggles to find clean releases against press coverage due to play strength and foot quickness. High-volume production helped by high percentage of short throws and wide receiver screens. Sticky out of breaks and unable to shake tight coverage. Limited amount of burst and wiggle after the catch and won't create much more than is there. Not overly-committed as a run blocker., Round 2,," Possesses high football character and a desire to push himself forward. Record-breaking receptions totals in 2016 were due more to scheme and excessive targets than separation ability or top-end speed. As a one-on-one receiver on the pro level, he will have to prove he has the speed and quickness to uncover against man coverage if he is to become more than just wide receiver depth."
Jarron Jones,DT," Former high school basketball player with exciting athletic traits. Able to pursue with quickness in space. Has foot quickness to change direction and extend his tackle radius. Arms are like tentacles that go on and on. Length advantage can be a nightmare for centers who line up against him. Lateral quickness opens doors into backfield as a penetrator. Can be a disruptive force on the other side of the line. Has explosiveness out of stance and up the field as a pass rusher. Combines early explosiveness with rare length to generate pocket push. Frequently a nose, but has the tool box and traits to play three- or five-technique as a pro. Has dominant potential if hand usage and pad level can be coached out of him. Has blocked four kicks during his injury-shortened career at Notre Dame.", Top heavy. Missing mass through thighs and in calves. Gets battered by down blocks and can be rooted out of gap due to lack of anchor in lower half. Comes off the ball too tall. Needs to play with more consistent bend to alleviate pad level issues. High center of gravity produces issues with balance when thumped with a redirect block. Needs to recognize cut blocks and stuff them more consistently. Scouts consider him unmotivated and question his football character. Doesn't treat offseason as a time to get better. Sources say Irish coaches had to work overtime to keep him interested and working to get better. Injuries have limited his growth as a player and his overall production. Missed final three games in 2014 with Lisfranc injury and the entire 2015 regular season with a torn MCL. Came back for bowl game that season and injured his foot in that game., Round 6-7, Jordan Phillips," Elite size, length and athleticism make Jones an intriguing early round prospect, but history of injuries and concerns over his football character could cause him to fall somewhat. Might have been miscast along the Irish defensive front as his playing style and body type appear to be much more suited further away from the nose spot. Jones' flashes will be tempting, but his lack of production and even snap count should be an immediate red flag along with the ""proceed with caution"" whispers coming from inside the program. If he can find consistent motivation, Jones could become a very good NFL starter in any defensive scheme. A true boom-or-bust prospect."
Tyler Orlosky,C," Team captain and three-year starter. Has mentality teams look for. Weight-room strong with good thickness through chest and arms. Field demeanor fueled by mean streak. Plays with desired body control and very little wasted motion. Works to maintain balance through contact. Compact, snap-to-punch motion. Great hands. Consistent hand placement as run blocker looking to carry defender out of the gap with low, cradling motion. Hands like powerful clamps that latch and allow for longer sustainment of blocks. Has redirect power to push pass rushers off their track to the quarterback. Quick punch allows for control in pass pro. Can drop a shallow anchor if pad level is right.", Cumbersome lateral movement and labors to get hips into position. Unable to cut off stunts with footwork. Might not possess enough sink in hips to operate in leveraged position as drive blocker. Inconsistent at running feet through second-level contact. Needs to show more consistent finishes as run blocker. Susceptible to stab moves due to shorter arms. Needs to play with better anticipation in pass protection. Lacks reactive quickness to consistently recover against twists and delayed blitzes., Round 6-7, Corey Linsley," Has the natural power to face off and compete against NFL nose guards, but lack of length and leverage could put a cap on where teams are willing to draft him. Functional in space. Lack of lateral quickness isn't a big enough weakness to prevent him from making a living as an NFL starter. Though limited, he has average starter's potential."
Jehu Chesson,WR," Angular, but features NFL size and plus catch radius. Foot quickness considered adequate. Ball tracker with good concentration. Feasts on combat catches in a crowd. Willing to take his lumps to secure the catch. Can leap and contort in mid-air to snare the difficult catch. Makes quick adjustments to poor throws. Squares back to shield safeties from interfering with catch on deep, in-breaking routes. Showed toughness, confidence and talent in successful bowl performance against Florida's Vernon Hargreaves in 2015 season. Understands art of hand-fighting. Has some dog in him as a run blocker and will compete to the whistle.", Suffered knee injury in bowl game his junior season and dealt with extended recovery time. Didn't look like the same guy in 2016 and production dropped substantially. Struggled to find necessary separation quickness in his routes. Defaulted to body catches too often in 2016. Play-strength issues show up against aggressive press corners. Forced to work overtime to free himself from a strong jam. Cornerbacks show no fear of his vertical speed. Effectiveness and quality of routes is below par. Tall into his breaks and will give routes away. Appeared to go through the motions in some games. Just average after the catch., Rounds 4-5, Brian Quick," Chesson looked like a shell of his 2015 self for much of the 2016 season. Erratic quarterback play didn't help his production, but an inability to separate and a noticeable drop in confidence were also culprits. Has NFL size and ball skills but long speed and play strength are deficiencies that could limit him as a pro. If he can revert back to his 2015 form, he has WR2 or WR3 potential. But at this point, he appears to be a Day 3 pick who could struggle to find snaps early in his career."
Tre'Davious White,CB," Experienced island corner with slot reps over last two seasons. Quick twitch with exceptional footwork. Uses controlled hop-steps from press for extended face-up against receivers. Patient in press and rarely commits prematurely. Uses reactive quickness for quick recovery when beaten from slot. Pattern reader will jump path of route and attack throw. Plus click-and-close burst to ball. Impressive 15 passes defensed on 42 targets in 2016. Stop-start change of direction allows him to shadow in tight quarters. Sticky coverage on crossers and intermediate routes. Rose to challenge in coverage of Amari Cooper in 2014 and Calvin Ridley in 2016. Improved willingness to attack line of scrimmage and do his part against the run. Awarded coveted No. 18 jersey at LSU, symbolizing success and selfless attitude on and off the field. Three-year punt returner with a return touchdown in each season. Was also used as a gunner."," Finesse cornerback with relatively slender frame. Physicality and play strength a concern from slot. Big-bodied slot targets will post him up in space and drive him off the line in run game. Tackles when necessary, but doesn't seek out contact. Less technique-oriented and more grabby from slot. Finished career with just six interceptions despite extensive playing time. Early anchor from off coverage caused struggles opening hips when receivers would stem and go. Recovery-quick but not recovery-fast. Texas Tech speedster Jakeem Grant gave him all kinds of vertical work in 2015 Texas Bowl.", Rounds 1-2, Tracy Porter," Full-time starter for better part of four years and one of the premier mirror-and-match cornerbacks in the game. Has the feet, athleticism and instincts for prolonged coverage responsibilities and his twitch will always have him near the throw. Best suited for all forms of man coverage. Should compete as special teams performer. Lacks run-support physicality to be an every-down corner, but he's talented enough to challenge for slot duties right away."
Conor McDermott,OT," Towering left tackle. Has experience in a pro-style attack. Gets into kick-slide without much laboring. Decent pass-slide quickness. Decent hand readiness. In run game, comes off ball with flat back and uncorks his hips into target. Generates some pop with his initial contact as run blocker. Has some redirect power to stuff stunts inside. Solid cut-blocker. Athletic feet with rare background. Was finalist for McDonald's High School All-American team as a senior basketball player and won Mr. Basketball for Division II-AA in Tennessee."," Very little bubble with below-average leg thickness. Plays too upright and with some stiff-leggedness. Lack of bend affects his ability to change direction. Hit-or-miss connection percentage on second level. Core strength is well-below desired NFL level. Bull-rushers can put him on skates and roll him back into the quarterback. Operates with weak punch in pass sets. Rare to find him land hands inside defender's frame on consecutive snaps. Doesn't trust his own foot quickness. Opens way too early in pass sets. Over-sets in race to the edge, allowing defenders to beat him inside or knock him off-balance with an inside club move.", Round 7,," McDermott's impressive high school resume is usually an attention-grabber for NFL offensive line coaches looking for athletes. However, his lack of functional core strength is a debilitating weakness that could make it tough for him to maintain an NFL career. McDermott's size will likely get him drafted, but there are quite a few holes in his game that are in desperate need of work."
Chad Kelly,QB," Good arm talent. Will make ""wow"" throws, especially early in games. Has shown an ability to make bold, anticipatory throws over the deep middle. Over final two seasons at Ole Miss, saw 13.6% of his pass attempts go for 20-plus yards, a higher percentage than both Deshaun Watson and DeShone Kizer. Can alter release to account for sudden shifts and movements by defense or his own receivers. Poise is good enough. Will pump, slide, and re-set his feet to make accurate throws. Can set up and fire quickly from the pocket. When he sits down on throws, will use lower body to drive the ball through his targets. Gamer with a competitive streak that runs deep. Touch throws are in his repertoire when attacking area between linebackers and safeties. Looks comfortable in rollouts and boot-action throws. Completed 66.7 percent of his passes when on the move in 2016. Shuffles to safe spots inside the pocket and is able to scramble out of pressure and find targets. Willing runner with runs of 43 and 41 yards over last two seasons. Attacks the middle of the field with accuracy and throws consistent strikes to stationary targets."," Lacks desired size and willing to take way too many hits outside the pocket. Has worked almost exclusively from shotgun and pistol. Struggles to maintain early success after halftime defensive adjustments. Completed just 2-of-12 deep shots down the left sideline in 2016. Under-throws some deep balls when trying to pass with touch. Inconsistent air under the ball. Saw interception percentage skyrocket when throwing to left side of the field. Woeful on back-shoulder fades. When pressure heads his way, he tucks and scoots rather than stands and delivers. Has random bouts of inaccuracy on wide receiver screens and outs. Throws nose-dive on move throws. Inconsistent working through progressions. Fails to see wide-open receivers, opting instead to make his job harder. Mind appears to be racing at times. Needs to manipulate safeties with lingering glares. Considered a character concern by some scouts; kicked off Clemson team for ""detrimental conduct.""", Round 5-6, Andy Dalton," He's hardly a scouting favorite based on reputation and inconsistency, but Kelly has attributes that could make him an eventual starter in the league if his personal and football character are kept in check. Kelly's competitive nature and willingness to challenge defenses will lead to some hot-and-cold moments, but there is some talent to work with there."
Taywan Taylor,WR," Stutter-steps around press coverage and into his work. Runs routes with a purpose. Changes route speeds almost at random, creating discomfort in cover corners. Hits accelerator to get over the top on vertical routes. Easy strider with fluid hips in the open field. Impressive plant-and-go separation explosion. Differentiator from slot with suddenness and burst. Gets head around to quarterback immediately out of breaks. Effective sink and open on stop routes. Dynamic after the catch. Finds yards for himself in open field. Has brake-to-gas quickness and elusive, swiveling torso. Always competing. Nifty near sideline with ability to deaden feet and make the challenging catch. Outstanding production despite defenses focusing on him."," Feasted on bubble screens, jet sweeps and several catch-and-run plays. Route variances could create some issues in systems requiring more timing. NFL route work will have to be more focused with less freestyle. Body catcher who will have the occasional focus drop. If he doesn't work back harder to his quarterback, body catches could turn into issues with contested catches. Lacked quality cornerback competition across from him for most of his career. Very aware of where safeties lurk in middle of the field.", Round 3, Stefon Diggs," Slot-only receiver with the athleticism and separation quickness to win on the NFL level. Benefitted statistically from Western Kentucky's scheme, but that offense benefitted from Taylor's ability to get open and his explosiveness in the open field. High floor with the potential to be an above-average slot receiver in an offense that recognizes his flexibility."
Taylor Moton,OG, Big off the bus. Massive frame with good arm thickness and proportional build in his legs. Plus arm length with big hands. Starting experience at right guard and tackle. Comes off the ball with pad level. Makes concerted effort to drop hips and roll under his target at contact. Has dominant drive-blocking potential. His down blocks turn into steam-rollings. Coordinates hips and hands for maximum pop through point of contact as run blocker. Held his own against Ohio State in 2015 and smothered Illinois DE Dawuane Smoot this season. A bear with strong paws. Plays tend to end for defender once he latches on. Functional climbing to second-level target. Bull rushers wont bully him very often.," Will need to play with quicker hands into punch as guard. Looping, wide approach with hands toward target could open his chest to defenders. Footwork needs plenty of work. Needs choppier feet. Waist bending in run game needs correction. Content to make blocks at angles that need to be squared up. Lateral and move blocks feature inconsistent base width. Issues coming to balance before contact if block isn't right in front of him. Average body control and athleticism. Will be limited to primarily power-based schemes. Has issues with oversetting in pass pro. Can be fooled by twists.", Round 2-3, Zach Fulton," Four-year starter for ascending Western Michigan program. Size and potential to dominate at the point of attack with pure power should make him a coveted right guard prospect. He can be a little stiff in his movements and his footwork needs plenty of work, but he's functional in both areas. Might need additional work before he is ready to take on the wily, athletic defensive tackles in the NFL, but his physical traits and power give him a chance to become a reliable NFL starter."
Takkarist McKinley,DE," Relentless worker bee on the field. Refuses to give offensive tackles a snap to catch their breath. Not a content player and is always charging towards the ball. Plus closing burst to sideline enables contain. Makes as many effort plays as anyone in the Pac 12. Unusually adept at bouncing off of blocks and maintaining play focus. Good stop/start change of direction talent. Long strides eat up ground in space. Scouts expect a strong forty time at combine. Combines speed with long arms for increased tackle radius. Became a playmaker. Saw 36 percent of his tackles come within two yards or less of line of scrimmage while sack total spiked considerably. Spins out of wash down blocks to work back towards the play. Consistently stuffs cut attempts. Raw, but pass rush flashes some speed to power. Pass rush counters fueled by lateral agility and effort."," Hand skill and overall usage is completely uncultivated and impedes pass rush potential. Lacks slaps, swipes and a serviceable rip move to grease the edge as a rusher. Punch has very little force. Needs to get hands and feet need in unison. Long arms are irrelevant at times due to slow punch. Lacks bend around the edge. Upright pass rush allows tackles to flatten him up and over the rush arc with just an average punch. Movements are a little bit stiff. Redirected too easily. Needs to continue to add play strength. Success predicated on effort over rush talent and functional power. Needs to combine all three elements to his game.", Round 1, Tamba Hali," Ascending edge prospect who racked up impressive TFL and sack numbers this year despite a relatively raw approach and skill set. He's a little stiff in his lower body, but flashes good athleticism once the ball is snapped. McKinley's motor is a translatable characteristic, but improved hand usage and pass rush mechanics are what could elevate his game to another level as a starting, 3-4 outside linebacker."
Dan Feeney,OG, Tough guy with a banger mentality. Decent arm length for the position. Above-average pass protector on interior. Feet are light enough to slide quickly in either direction to protect the edge in pass-pro. Very aware of twists and blitzes. Shoots a strong punch that can jar gap shooters out of the gap and can put a sting into both twisters as he snaps and catches. Zone-blocking specialist with desired lateral quickness. Takes well-planned routes up to second-level targets on difficult backside cutoffs. Able to get around corner with pace when asked to long pull. Good patience. Finds his landmarks and strikes them. Rarely commits early to a block. Waits until he's in proper position. Plays with redirect power in his upper body. Will take it to the whistle and looks to finish with some menace. Effective blocker in screen game., Carries weight in upper body and lacks some sand in his pants. Pops upright after the snap. Poor pad level and a narrow base creates contact-balance issues. Shows a lack of knee bend that makes change of direction in space a task. Is a bit straight-linish in his approach. Unable to generate consistent push as a base blocker. Needs to improve hip sink for better leverage and to sustain his blocks. Hand speed is decent but punch is a little wide. Missed all of 2013 with a foot injury and missed four games due to effects from a concussion sustained early in the season., Round 2, Clint Boling," Four-year starter and two-time team captain, Feeney has been the consistent anchor along an Indiana offensive line that helped to produce NFL running backs Tevin Coleman and Jordan Howard. Feeney is a quality zone blocker with an ability to pull and lead the charge, but he might lack the play strength to become a reliable base blocker. His intelligence and ability to operate in space and protect the quarterback could make him an early starter with a ceiling of above-average NFL guard or center."
Nico Siragusa,OG," Compact, girthy frame with thickly muscled arms. Low center of gravity with adequate hip bend to unlock power. Strong core. Able to scoop under defenders and root them out. Drive blocker with strength to win individual battles. Better-than-expected maneuverability when asked to pull. Able to redirect his weight. Has anchor to pass-set at shallow depths and handle bull rushers. Showed a little more nasty in his game as a senior than he did in junior season. Great in the locker room and well liked."," Labors coming out of stance. Tends to pop upright and is delayed in his lateral movements. Reach blocks and cut-off blocks on middle linebackers are mission impossible. Hands are a little slow with inconsistent placement. Impatient with punch and will get caught lunging. Has to work to keep weight balanced in pass sets. Unable to punch and mirror, allowing active rushers a pathway to his edge.", Rounds 3-4, Chris Kemoeatu," Three-year starter with a penchant for power, but lacking the functional lateral movement to do consistent work outside of his phone booth. Has an NFL-ready frame with the ability to open holes for the running back but will likely appeal to power teams only. Pass protection could be a recurring issue early in his career."
Dion Dawkins,OG," Burly upper body and thick calves down below. Has shown enough upper-body strength to muscle his defender around even without using great leverage. Shows a natural amount of core strength to battle against bull rushers. Able to get out of stance and into his kick-slide with pretty good fluidity and quickness. Uses choppy steps to slide and rarely allows his base to get too narrow in pass protection or in the run game. Plays with balance. Uses aggressive, tight settle-step into defender and then fires hands and hips to help generate push in run game. Has experience in zone- and gap-running schemes. Full-time three-year starter at left tackle.", Hands are often too wide in pass protection and his punch turns into grabbing. Needs to keep hands quieter and inside pre-punch. Wide punch approach robs him of some of his natural length. Will head-butt into contact in pass pro. Can be a little inconsistent with footwork when attempting to redirect back inside against stunts. Has a little stiffness in his hips that limit his bend and could affect anchor. Gets caught over-committing on twists and will open the door for looping rushers. Needs to work on improving leverage rather than relying on pure power. Plays with inconsistent angles to the linebackers when making backside cut-off blocks., Round 2, Joe Barksdale," Quality tackle who operates with good balance and solid technique. Shows some good initial quickness and a smooth kick-slide out of his stance, but might be better in short areas as a guard rather than in open space as a tackle. He's athletic enough to operate in space, but power appears to be his calling card. His wide-hand approach in pass protection could be a difficult habit to break, but he has the natural power to withstand bull rush that might come with that. Dawkins is a well-schooled, three-year starter who has chance to transition into an early starter."
Montravius Adams,DT, Low out of his stance and with good explosiveness. Springs into gaps to stress guards and split double teams. Usually first into neutral zone. Disruptive when working the gaps. Burly lower half with good thickness through his hips and thighs. Powerful leg drive pushes him through blocker's shoulder and into the backfield. Motor seemed to be revved more consistently in 2016 than in 2015. Pursues from backside with hustle. Has some bull rush potential if he keeps pads low., Strikes head first with eyes down losing sight of the play. Doesn't utilize hands well enough to keep himself clean. Needs to improve punch and extension to add value as a two-gap tackle. Sticks on blocks and labors to disengage. Short stepper with limited lateral effectiveness as pass rusher. Active as rusher but fails to stress the edge often enough. Has carried label as underachiever at times. Has talent but needs to more consistently play to it., Rounds 2-3, Jay Bromley," Adams disappointed the scouting community with a pedestrian junior season that lacked passion and production. This season, he played with greater consistency of effort and found his way into the backfield far more often. Can be disruptive off the snap but is not the type of player to recover quickly if beaten early in the rep. He is a rotational defensive tackle for gap-attack defenses, but is unlikely to offer much as a pass rusher."
Carlos Watkins,DT," Athletic big man. Shows good movement skills for interior lineman. Operates in twisting, stunting defensive front at Clemson. Good lateral movement and agility creates problems for reach-blocking offensive linemen. Comes off the ball ready to punch and land first with his hands. Has closing burst down the line of scrimmage to challenge running backs looking to make back-side cut. Will stop his pass rush and activate hands in the passing lane when he sees quarterback begin wind-up. Played both nose and 3-technique at Clemson. Substantially more effective player if kept fresh in a rotation. Shows good awareness and recognition against screens."," Top-heavy with excess weight around midsection topping leaner lower body. Struggled to grow roots and stand up for himself against Alabama's powerful double teams. Pad level rises as snap progresses. Powerful guards can get under his pads and turn him out of the gap. Quality of play diminishes rapidly when fatigued. Needs to get early advantage as pass rusher or he won't be a factor. Missing quality counter moves as a rusher. Needs more aggressiveness at point of attack and shed blocker earlier. Motor runs hot and cold. Needs to show more explosive, sudden elements in his game.", Rounds 3-4, Sylvester Williams," While Watkins has had a productive, successful career at Clemson, it is hard to isolate the area of his game that he will call a definitive strength in the NFL. Watkins is athletic and may have rotational appeal to teams that covet active interior linemen. His top-heavy frame limits his anchor at the point of attack and if his motor isn't revved up, he gets put on skates too often against power. Watkins has some talent and his traits are NFL-worthy, but he could end up being a Day 3 selection who will need to play at a more consistent level in order to become a factor as a pro."
Lewis Neal,DE," Strong, thick trunk with good arm length and big, powerful hands. Can generate some pop into his initial contact. Often first with his hands landing on inner portion of the shoulder to command the point of attack. Short, compact frame provides natural leverage advantage. Uses leverage, arm extension and stout post leg to set a solid edge. Can stack, find the runner and disengage with decent success. Adequate agility and lateral quickness. Extremely sharp both on and off field.", Struggles to withstand double teams. Stubby and can be overwhelmed by size if he doesn't win early with his hands. Marginal threat as a rusher off the edge. Upfield get-off won't scare many tackles; not much knee bend there. Lacks the length and hip flip to climb over the edge as a rusher. Doesn't feature enough power to push pocket as interior rusher. Lacks necessary length to fit at defensive end and the power to handle life in the trenches., PFA,," Plays with strength at the point of attack but is currently lacking the necessary traits to be a clean fit at end or tackle. A solid football player who will end up in some team's camp come August, but making a roster will be a challenge unless a team has a specific role in mind for him."
Pat Elflein,C, Thick lower body. Team captain renown for his outrageous work ethic. Strong leadership characteristics both verbally and by example. Looks for work when uncovered. Smartly alters assignment based on flow of the defense. Always under control in his movements. Patient pull blocker who stalks his target rather than rushing the block. Plus play strength and wrestling background gives him a leg up in hand-to-hand combat against big dogs inside. Quick to roll hips into block after first contact. Drives feet through contact and uses strong hands to stick like glue to the block. Reliable and effective in down blocks. Finisher looking to make a statement at the end of the play. Has mental part down. Recognizes twisting defensive tackles and greets them with aggressiveness. Hand placement is excellent. Strikes with upward blows squarely into the strike zone as run blocker. Pass-pro punch is compact with some heat behind it. Can anchor against bull rush. Winning history on high-caliber team. Versatile; proficient and successful at both center and guard.," Not a ballerina with his feet. Footwork can be a little labored at times for the center position. Marginal twitch with short-area reaction time that is just average. A bit of a straight-line player in space. Struggles to come off initial block and body up against delayed, A-gap blitzers. Understands leverage but hip stiffness causes pad level to rise as play rolls along. Anticipates early bull rush and will drop an early anchor. Feet become heavy and limited, allowing athletic opponents to work around his edge and into backfield. Not always first with his hands. Gives away his chest to interior defenders with good hand quickness.", Rounds 2-3, Travis Frederick," Elflein is a smart, tireless worker with a winning background and experience at all three interior offensive line spots. While his feet are just average, his core strength and wrestling background could make him a favorite of teams looking for more strength at the center position. Elflein will have occasional issues in pass protection, but his strength as a run blocker and ability to play with excellent hands and plus body control should make him one of the first interior linemen to come off the draft board."
Josh Harvey-Clemons,S," Rangy, long frame with exceptionally long limbs. Arm length is what offensive line coaches look for in a tackle. Plays the game with edge and embraces physical requirement of the position. First responder who races downhill into the action. Rarely taps the brakes into his tackles. Square-up, wrap-up finisher. Took on blocks with aggressiveness and leverage when asked to play inside linebacker. His long arms help cast wide net as tackler. Rare athleticism for his size. Flips hips for instant change of direction as tackler or in coverage. Excellent range as a tackler. Plays faster than his timed speed. Communicative on the field. Balances attention between quarterback's eyes and assignments around him as two-deep safety. Quick to find coverage work after diagnosing play-action from the box. Adjusts coverage responsibilities based on scrambling direction of quarterback."," Skinny legs. Needs more discipline in playing with inside-out leverage in run support. Downhill GPS to running backs needs fine tuning. Tends to attack at angles under running back, forcing too many diving attempts on perimeter. Can be a little slow hustling back to high safety spot from disguised coverages. Deshaun Watson picked on him in coverage. From single-high position, needs anticipation and earlier response to throws. Will lose sight of deep responsibilities as high safety at times. Panics and grabs when he fears he's beaten. Needs to trust his length and recover speed more often. Dismissed from Georgia after three strikes, including failed marijuana tests.", Round 6-7, Kam Chancellor," Former five-star recruit with an alpha mentality who roams the field with swagger and undeniable intent as a tackler. Has elite size, length and athletic traits, and is a rangy tackler with the ability to cover and blitz. He could be considered by teams as a box safety or hybrid linebacker."
Tedric Thompson,FS," Quality athlete with desired long speed. High school wide receiver with good hands and outstanding ball skills. Can climb the ladder and challenge the jump ball. Works to stay in front of the route rather than trailing. Instincts and athleticism lead him to the throw. Successfully reads quarterback's intentions. Takes the playmaker's path to throws targeting catch point over receiver. Squeezes top of the route in zone. Finished with 10 interceptions at Colorado. Covers skills are a plus. Older brother, Cedric, was exceptional athlete as safety at Minnesota and was drafted by the Dolphins in 2015.", Average height for position and needs more muscle on his frame. Desire as a playmaker can be used against him. Bait routes can pull his attention away from deep help responsibilities in single-high looks. Path to ball as downhill tackler needs improvement. Grab-and-drag arm tackler over wrap-up finisher. Tends to attack from angles rather than squared up as tackler. Not much thud behind his pads as a hitter. Missed final four games of 2014 with lingering effects from a concussion., Rounds 3-4,," Thompson in an instinctive cover safety with strong ball skills and a history of production during his time at Colorado. Lacks physicality to operate around the box, but his football intelligence and playmaking skills will get him drafted and could give him a shot at eventually starting."
Taco Charlton,DE," Rare combination of size, length and athletic traits as a rusher. Long-levered frame with athletic, knotted calves. Brings freaky athletic traits to table and is still growing into his body. Flashes instant reaction time off snap and up the field thanks to his twitch. Has enough upfield juice to push offensive tackles into hasty retreat. Generates pop through speed-to-power element. Very good flexibility throughout. Able to sink and swerve around corner if he gets early lead in race to the edge. Possesses hip swivel combined with shoulder turn to slip and flip around the corner of an offensive tackle he's engaged with as a pass rusher. Rushes with forward lean that keeps his momentum downhill. Uses rip-and-stab move and an ominous spin move that could turn into a dominant rush trait in the NFL. Elongated lateral slides can open into sprint very quickly to chase run play bouncing outside. Length gives him a shot at dramatically increasing his play-making ability against the run. Hand usage is improving."," Despite talent and traits, production and overall play has been uneven at Michigan. Earned full-time starting nod in just his final season. Needs more weight-room work. Consistency of anchor at point of attack in question. Can be rooted out of his gap by power. Can do better job of using his length to keep blockers off of him. Doesn't make enough plays on other side of the line against run. Needs to show a nastier play demeanor at all times. Scouts question whether he has enough toughness for trench battles if bumped inside or to 5-technique. Held back by his inconsistent play speed. Excessive leaning and narrowing of his base during the play causes balance and footwork inconsistencies. Needs better readiness to take on move blockers.", Round 1, Chandler Jones," ""Inconsistent"" has been the buzzword that has followed Charlton since coming to Michigan, but he began the process of shaking it during his senior season. Charlton is an ascending prospect with the size, length, athleticism and pass-rushing potential that NFL general managers dream of. What you see today might not be what you get. While his production coming out of college will be modest, he could become a substantially better player as a pro if he's committed to the weight room and willing to absorb coaching. High-impact defensive end with all-pro potential is his ceiling. His floor is solid starter."
Josh Carraway,OLB," Outstanding athlete. Explosive with plenty of twitch. Has sudden, bouncy feet. Plus range as tackler. Possesses speed to win foot race down the line as a backside chaser when unblocked. Fluid hips and good acceleration to leverage wide, flowing runs to the sideline. Gets maximum arm extension when landing the early punch. Intriguing pass rusher. Has an NFL-level burst upfield. Flexibility creates ability to dip and corner the edge sharply. Has breathtaking closing burst to the quarterback as a rusher. Flashes of hand fighting provide hope for improvement. Transitioned from strong side to open side as a senior with no issues."," Playing demeanor is too kind. Needs to inject some dog in his play. Lightweight at setting the edge. Gets jostled around far too easily to be trusted against the run. Needs to cut hands loose earlier in the rep and with more purpose. Content to ride on blocks rather than fight his way through them. Passive at point of attack and rarely imposes his will downhill. Technique and footwork seem random at times. Will have to learn how to take on blocks and stand his ground. Easily washed down by down blocks. Ragged, grab-and-drag tackler. Will need to find counter rush move to offset lack of play strength against redirect blocks around the arc.", Rounds 6-7, Shaquille Riddick," Several boxes go unchecked for Carraway, but his outstanding athleticism and potential as an edge rusher will provide draft value. His instincts are a long way off and he lacks the functional strength and toughness at the point of attack that most teams require on the edge, but a big combine could heat his draft stock up. He will require patience and much more technique work, but he does possess NFL traits as a developmental prospect."
Jordan Willis,OLB," Good eyes vs. zone read; sees mesh point clearly. Quick responder once he diagnoses the action. Excellent change of direction ability to stay in the hunt. Finishes tackles, rarely allowing runners to escape grasp. Pursuit will not stop until the whistle blows. Proficient with hands. Hands are strong and control the action. Well-schooled with excellent stack-and-shed ability. Good strength in base and plays with adequate contact balance. Stays clean setting edge while spying into backfield. Uses blockers' forward lean against them, sends them tumbling forward. Arm over is a pet move that gives him early wins. Track-stance pass rusher who comes out of the blocks with decent burst to the edge. Hard worker. Productive in sacks and forced fumbles over final two seasons at KSU."," Straight-liner mover. Very deliberate as a pass rusher. Shows rush moves early and rarely deviates from original track. One-speed rusher lacking dynamic qualities to turn corner for tight loops. Could get flattened in the rush arc due to hip tightness. Timing of hands need work as he tends to shoot prematurely, opening himself up to counter moves. Rarely makes tackles redirect inside with sharp counters. Tackles often come at angles. Might need to move to outside linebacker on next level.", Round 2, Kyle Emanuel," Productive three-year starter who plays with desired motor from whistle to whistle. Willis is a stack-and-shed edge defender with good play strength and quality hand work at the point of attack. He will need more creativity to be an effective NFL pass rusher, but he should be able to earn a roster spot and work his way up the pecking order in either a 3-4 or 4-3 scheme."
Jordan Leggett,TE," Outstanding size for the position. Has experience playing in-line, from slot, and as a wingback. Former high school receiver with natural, confident hands to snatch throws out in front of him. Just two drops over final two college seasons. Desired foot quickness in tight quarters. Seam-buster in Clemson's offense. Has feel for finding the throw when working over top of linebackers between the hashes. Able to drop and dig out the low throws. Shows some ability to turn out edge linebackers when he puts his mind to it. Rises to the occasion, with big games against Florida State in 2015 and 2016 and another against Alabama in National Championship. Saw his yards-per-touch increase to 17.1 in 2016.", Has referred to himself as lazy in the past. Passion and urgency seem to be tied to a switch he flips for the big games. Lacks natural flexibility as an athlete. Shows stiffness in his routes. Leans into his breaks rather than sink hips and has no explosion out of his cuts. Struggles to get route back on track quickly once redirected with force. Catch radius is marginal. Fights his body to adjust to throws behind him and high. Loose with football after the catch. Aggressiveness and desire to block are questioned by scouts. Lacks instincts and block-sustaining as a move blocker. Accepts the brunt of the force at the point of attack. Is a little plodding coming off line of scrimmage and into his routes., Round 4, Kellen Davis," Has elite size for the position, but his motor and effort leave a lot to be desired. Despite his size, might not have the attitude necessary to be an in-line blocker on the NFL level. Tape shows a route-runner who could struggle to uncover against quality man coverage. Leggett has traits and talent, but his production was helped along by Clemson's system. Will need a more ramped-up motor to reach his potential."
Jeremy Sprinkle,TE," Combination tight end who doesn't have to leave the field. Has arm length and base to help in pass protection. Effective blocker willing to do the physical work. Snaps into down blocks and secures. Strong hands lead to sustained blocks. Able to engage and sustain against safeties in space. Long frame with room to carry more weight. Has arm length and hand size of an NFL offensive tackle. Big, presentable target over the middle. Plus red-zone worker. Sells blocks on delayed-release play-action. Burrows into holes of zone and protects passes with his frame. Goes down to pick low throws off top of grass. Sneaky build-up of speed in routes. Long strides eat up ground as route progresses. Can pull away from linebackers on intermediate routes. Uses height, arm length, and high-point technique to go way up the ladder and over top of defenders. Nasty stiff-arm after catch. Above-average body control for size."," Needs more work on arm day in the gym. Upper-body thickness hasn't caught up with frame yet. Feet a bit heavy out of release and into routes. Legs and arms flail away into some of his breaks. Below-average at utilizing route leverage to create additional throwing room for quarterbacks. Needs to adjust crossing routes to keep defenders on his hip. Lacks short-area quickness to make defenders miss after catch. Needs to work back to ball more often. If block assignment vacates, he doesn't find new work. Instincts as blocker need work as he appears lost at times. Hand placement is average. Ankle injury limited his effectiveness for about a month.", Rounds 4-5, Larry Donnell," True ""Y"" tight end with outstanding length and a frame that can handle more weight. Has the toughness to be an NFL blocker, but might need to add more upper- and lower-body strength before he's ready. He's a big, reliable target in the red zone and underneath against zone, but needs a longer runway to create separation in his routes. Sprinkle isn't great in any one area, but he's good in most and should be a safe pick and quality starter in the league."
Haason Reddick,LB," Explosive, quick-twitch athlete. Great flexibility with loose hips to turn, twist, and chase. Excellent reactive quickness and change-of-direction agility. Dynamic playmaker in space. Locks onto targets and instantly accelerates to the ball. Finished 2016 regular season with 21.5 tackles for loss. Fluid mover around field. Has chase range over extended territory. Eyes work past blockers and into backfield. Slips and slides around the edge and through small creases. Always working feet into improved positioning after contact. Came in as a defensive back and has experience on all three levels. Has athleticism in space and necessary instincts to be legit cover talent as linebacker. Rushes with good bend and forward lean. Difficult to handle on tackle/end twists back inside. Turns corner with tight track to quarterback once he pries the edge open."," Undersized by NFL standards for position he's currently playing. Labors to disengage once size is on top of him. Will need more play strength to ward off NFL blockers. Improving with hands, but needs to continue technique work to control blockers. Lacks necessary bulk, length, and play strength to set a strong edge as an NFL 3-4 outside linebacker. Marginal speed-to-power ability. Connects and sticks to tackles when trying to bull-rush under their pads. Pass rush reliant upon athletic talent and cursory hand play. Needs more diversified rush plans. Slides off of too many tackles. Missed 16 tackles over final two seasons at Temple. Needs to chest-up and run feet through contact. Played in fewer than 70 percent of team's defensive snaps.", Round 1, Ryan Shazier," Injuries limited Reddick to just four games over last two years of high school, forcing him to walk on at Temple. The Owls staff helped him unlock his explosive athletic traits on the field, which resulted in three forced fumbles, 9.5 sacks and 21.5 tackles for loss in 2016. Reddick's speed and athleticism might give him a greater shot at impacting the game as a 3-4 inside linebacker or a 4-3 WILL rather than trying to bulk up and play the edge. An ascending prospect with a high-end potential if he can continue to hone his craft."
Greg Pyke,OG, Gritty and determined. Fights as hard as he can on each play. Has starting experience at both guard and tackle. Comfortable lateral movement when asked to pull. Gets out in front as puller or in screen passes with good pace. Initial blow carries some pop and continues to work his feet through the contact. Works double teams well as a guard.," Short legs with longer torso. Lacking NFL length. Leads with chest and is late with hands. Beaten frequently in battle for ""first hands"" into frame. Below-average body control. Difficulties coming to balance and redirecting his weight in space. Unable to sustain blocks for very long. Tight hips and narrow base allow defenders to slide off of his blocks. Tends to play upright and straight-legged.", PFA,," Played both guard and tackle at Georgia but is a guard-only prospect. Pyke plays with great effort and determination and loves to bury his opponent when he gets a chance, but his lack of balance, leverage, and length limit his opportunities to become a productive NFL starter."
Gerald Everett,TE," Slick athlete with leftover wide receiver traits. Easy acceleration into routes and can blow by safeties who sit down looking for a route break for too long. Good acceleration off of plant foot in route breaks. Can create immediate separation. Carries play speed throughout routes. Cover linebackers are usually in for a rough day vs. Everett, who eats in the middle of the field and shows no fear. Maximizes arm length for wide catch radius. Hands look fairly natural as pass catcher. Adds to totals with yards after catch. Runs physically and with excellent balance. Rips his legs through arm-tackle attempts. Instinctive runner who sets up blocks on bubble screens. Alters stride length to elude diving tackle attempts. Able to work all three levels of the field. Blocks with anger and is prone to longer engagements than most blockers on perimeter. Put on a show, including game-winning touchdown, in upset of Mississippi State on the road."," Route running doesn't appear to be high on his priority list. Routes are rounded, dull and lack urgency. Leans into most of his breaks. Talented cover safeties can jump his routes. Drifts on square-ins, allowing deep safeties a door into the play. Needs work on double moves. Could have issues playing through route redirection off line of scrimmage. Shows deceleration when locating ball on deep throws. Hands are small. Too many one-handed stab attempts on throws outside his frame limit ability to make the ""wow"" catches. Touchdown production lower than expected.", Round 2, Quincy Enunwa," It's difficult to find a good comparison for Everett because his size and toughness are similar to Marshall's coming out, but his playing style resembles Delanie Walker at times. Everett has size, speed and tremendous run-after-catch potential, but it is his willingness and ability to block that separates him from other ""matchup"" tight ends. Route running is below average, but he should improve with NFL coaching. Everett has the talent to become a very good NFL starter with Pro Bowl potential if he puts it all together."
Forrest Lamp,OG," Compact build but not lacking athleticism. Able to redirect weight back inside. Showed nimble feet when handling spin moves and inside shots from LSU's Arden Key in 2015. Patient. Works feet and hips into position before engaging. Secures block with chopping feet and quality positioning. Bends and looks for low-man leverage with hip thrust under him. Uses short, controlled punch in run game. Clever with hands in pass protection. Throws short, teaser jab with outside hand to entice rushers into premature hand fighting. Effective counter-puncher defending edge and clears his chest and re-sets hands if defender gets into him first. Rarely bull-rushed. Processes quickly when defense runs games up front.", Average frame and might not be able to add much more bulk to it. Lack of height and arm length will likely drive him inside. Expedited engagement on interior could prevent counter-punching style with hands. Will have to learn to keep hands in ready position and shoot them with tighter track into the frame. Positional blocker lacking NFL power as a drive-blocking guard. Lack of girth will require consistent pad level and a little wider base., Round 1, Zach Martin," Four-year starter at left tackle whose lack of length will likely force him inside on the next level. He has the athleticism to handle athletic interior rushers while being able to fit into diverse rushing attacks that ask more from the guards and centers. His ability to potentially line up at tackle, guard or center will only increase his value. Lamp's 2016 performance against Alabama's talented edge players was a resume-builder that shined a spotlight on his potential as a pro."
Ethan Pocic,C," Five-for-one lineman offering roster flexibility; has played tackle, guard and center. Determined player. Shoots hands inside defenders frame and keeps them there. Shows the hand strength and body control to ""ride the bull"" against stronger players while remaining engaged. Rapid lateral movement allows him to slide along his gap to pick up blitzers. Pass sets feature adequate base width and solid hand quickness. Fluid combo-blocker who glides easily to his second-level targets with good angles. Patient blocker on second level. Able to wait as long as possible for committing to his block in space. Features good body control and high connection rate on blocks in space. Athletic on pull blocks and screens and able to make blocks well down the field. Smart and makes the offensive calls."," Tall for a center, losing some leverage battles because of it. Athletic ability offset by below-average core strength. Doesn't play with the pad level or leg drive to uproot defenders without help. Gets jarred by power across from him. Upper body strength needs work. Anchor will always be an issue against zero-technique nose guards. Gives into pocket pushers, creating traffic in the backfield. Defenders able to drive through his edge and redirect attempts. Can be quicker into proper positioning for reach blocks. Has difficulty securing zone blocks at times.", Round 2-3, Brandon Linder," Flexible, natural athlete with starting experience all along the LSU offensive line. Scouts say Pocic has the intelligence teams look for from a center and is highly regarded by LSU coaches and teammates in the locker room. Pocic is an excellent ""work-up"" blocker with the ability to thrive in a running game that operates in space, but his lack of power will produce some extremely challenging matchups for him at times."
Donnel Pumphrey,RB," Produced at high levels. Patient but decisive when he sees it. Accesses instant turbo burst. Rarely loses races to and around the edge. Plus vision creates ability to navigate shifting run creases like a seasoned veteran. Slaloms through traffic from side to side with seamless, tight jump cuts. Keeps tight track through the gaps, maintaining distance from defensive linemen. Able to string moves together. Razor-sharp cutbacks at challenging angles are his thing. Made a rare 90-degree cut out of a downhill run against South Alabama. Excels in outside zone but has courage to stick it between tackles. Extremely elusive in open field after catch. Used as matchup weapon out of backfield. Good route runner who creates necessary separation."," Undersized. Lacks the leg thickness and overall physical strength desired out of an NFL running back. Spirit is willing but flesh is weak. Arm tackles are able to end his journey. Willing to accelerate into defender, but doesn't have the pop to break tackles or fall forward after contact. Quicker than fast. Will get caught from behind. Body catcher with average hands that lead to double catches. Too small to protect against NFL blitzers as third-down back.", Round 5-6, Tyler Ervin," Pumphrey is an efficient, natural back who runs with outstanding tempo and vision. Has outstanding agility and ability to disappear and leave tacklers grasping at air in open field. While he has good burst and quickness, he does lack the home-run speed expected from such small running backs. He won't even be an option for teams married to physical minimums, but there is a place on the roster for his talent provided he can become a return man or viable receiving option as well."
Devonte' Fields,OLB," Talented athlete with loose hips. Has foot quickness and agility to become more disruptive player if motor catches. Has an undeniable burst to the ball once he sees the opening. Able to close out quarterbacks and ball carriers quickly. Can twitch and make sudden change-of-direction leaps to secure running backs racing through the line of scrimmage. Able to mirror and sack scrambling quarterbacks. Subtle change of direction and shifting of gears creates openings for him as a rusher. Possesses quick, inside jump-cut as a counter rush move. Better pad level could elevate effectiveness of his counter."," Short strider who doesn't come up the field at full speed to threaten edge. Hands linger at the top of the pass rush. Needs to be more physical and explosive with hands for greasing the edge for decisive wins. Effort level needs an upgrade. Tends to loaf if play isn't headed in his direction. Inconsistent production since his freshman season at TCU. Has issues holding ground against power. Catches blocks over punching and separating to control the point of attack. Character red flags are a concern. Kicked out of TCU as a sophomore following domestic-violence allegations (he was eventually charged, but the charges were dismissed after he agreed to attend an anger-management course).", Round 6-7, Dadi Nicolas," Undersized end who will have to play as an open-side rush linebacker on the next level. Fields flashes impressive athletic gifts and opens a window into his potential, but takes too many plays off and is lacking the play demeanor NFL teams desire. Fields' off-field character will be vetted, but it is his football character that has scouts concerned about whether he can play to his potential."
DeMarcus Walker,DE," Ties quick swim move to his jump-step in order to climb over top of pass protection. Posted eye-popping sack production (25) over last two seasons at FSU. Attempts to play past the blocker rather than giving in. Always searching for new opening when original rush move is stymied. When rush stalls, he spies quarterback and gets hand in alleys. Eight career passes defensed. Gathers blockers to set up teammates when first on twists. Active, heavy tackler. Stack-and-shed power on the edge when pad level is right. Thick bubble and thighs with ability to carry more mass. Able to stuff cut blocks and keep his feet clean. Hasty with hands and lands first. Engages and mirrors flow of running back with square pads. Durable and dependable; played in 90 percent of the defensive snaps 2016."," Inconsistent motor. Allows backside tackle opportunities to escape his grasp when he's not hustling. Range as a tackler is average. A step slow when sliding down line to constrict cutback lanes. Needs to show quicker feet. Struggles to work feet and hips back into playmaking position once beaten on reach blocks. Pops straight and loses his leverage when fatigued. Doesn't have the juice or hips to consistently bend the edge as a pro rusher. Needs two-way goes to do his best pass rush work. Moves well, but lacks suddenness and play speed is average. Level of play greatly impacted by fatigue level.", Rounds 2-3, Mario Edwards," Walker's sack totals are impressive, but he's not the type of ""early win"" sack artist that generally post those types of numbers. He's a base end with power to hold up at the point, but better suited to reduce inside as interior rusher on passing downs. Walker lacks the desired size and physical traits teams look for off the edge; a move to three-technique isn't out of the question."
Dede Westbrook,WR," Plays with sudden feet in tight quarters. Uncovers quickly while working underneath. Rhythmic cadence in his routes. Dangerous after the catch. Vertical transitions in his routes are smooth and sudden with loads of acceleration. Patient in routes and reads corners hips to time his cuts. Works back to most every throw with vacuum-like hands. Improviser who finds open spots for a scrambling quarterback. Leverages cornerbacks toward hash to create throwing room to boundary on fades and deep balls. Long speed looks legit. Runs under and through the deep ball with desired tracking over his shoulder. More than 25 percent of his catches went for 25-plus yards in 2016. Plays bigger than his size. Willing worker in front of safeties in middle of the field. Shadow blocker, but willing to maintain positioning as long as he has to. Utilized as kick and punt returner in important spots. Had punt return touchdown and kick return of 63 yards in 2016.", Thin legs on painfully thin frame. Could have issues holding up against NFL size. Can be a little lackadaisical with the simple routes. Needs to back corners off with greater show of vertical push into routes. Play speed is inconsistent. Ohio State leveraged him against the boundary and he couldn't escape. Production helped along by woeful opponents across from him. Allowed free releases and rarely faced physical challenges. Could struggle with contested catches on the next level due to size. Scheme allowed for less safety help over the top and more one-on-one looks. Character concerns will need to be addressed with NFL teams., Round 2, Travis Benjamin," Natural glider with ability to play outside but could be moved to slot due to size concerns. Often found running in the clear thanks to strong double moves and weak competition. Evaluating Westbrook is challenging due to a lack of strong competition, but his separation quickness, second gear, and reliable hands are all translatable play traits that should turn into catches on the next level."
Stacy Coley,WR, Smooth and rhythmic as a runner. Able to eat into corner cushion right away and put slower corners into panic mode. Has desired forward lean into routes and operates with consistent tempo. Strong vertical push frees him for wide-open looks underneath against off-coverage. Creates separation on crossers and posts with his speed alone. Operates with plus body control. Makes late adjustments to throws to snare challenging catches. Possesses another gear to track down the deep shots. Overcame early drop issues over first two seasons in Miami. Dangerous post-catch. Eludes tacklers in cramped quarters and can burst to daylight.," Scouts question his passion for the game. Basic release fundamentals off line of scrimmage rarely cross up press corners. Route work needs an overhaul. His breaks are rounded and predictable. Good pattern readers will run his routes for him. Tries to create openings with uninspired head fakes and stiff upper body. Patterns lack leverage points to create space. Has some issues tracking the deep ball. Taps brakes prematurely when he can't find ball early. Could struggle against big, physical bump-and-run cornerbacks. Successful intermediate work was rare. Shoulder issues sidetracked him in 2014 and he was slowed by hamstring problems in 2015.", Rounds 5-6, Chris Harper," Might lack the release ability and play strength to line up outside. Best-suited as a vertical slot receiver who can stretch the field and uncover underneath thanks to athleticism and burst. Raw and might not have the football character necessary to make a dent in the league. However, he has the athletic traits that could make a viable slot option with big-play potential. Durability and ability to contribute on special teams are likely essential."
Davis Webb,QB, Stands tall in the pocket with a high release point. Rhythm passer. Can drive it with accuracy between hashes when allowed to sling from a clean pocket. Shows patience to allow crossing routes to clear traffic. Expedites release with compact delivery when blitzed. Functional poise with blitz in his face. Slides to create cleaner platform to launch from when pocket gets noisy. Internal clock is operational. Has feel for when ball has been in his hands too long and will look to release it. Feet are good enough to operate in a boot-action passing attack. Completion percentage saw an uptick in the fourth quarter in 2016., Robotic decision-making. Decision on where to go with ball seems predetermined despite coverages. Needs to get better at manipulating safeties with his eyes. Inconsistent velocity to sideline causes nose of ball to dip. Drive throws sometime sail. Has slow setup in pocket with excessive pre-release steps. Cornerbacks contest too many throws due to lack of anticipation. Timing passes must come out sooner.  Plagued by accuracy issues and decision-making outside the numbers on both intermediate and deep throws. Five of his 12 interceptions in 2016 were along deep sidelines due to under-throws and failure to read safety help. Touch and placement are an issue when forced to leave the pocket. Not a factor as a scrambler., Round 2, Brock Osweiler," System quarterback with more than 65 percent of his attempts coming inside of 10 yards. Webb has enough raw talent to be considered a developmental prospect, but his decision-making and accuracy issues beyond 10 yards is a big red flag that might be tough to overcome in the NFL."
Cooper Kupp,WR," Elite level of production for any level of football. Finished career as Division I career leader in receptions, yards and touchdowns. Hands are natural and strong. Catches passes like his idol, Larry Fitzgerald. Plucks it away from his body and immediately tucks it away. Utilizes route speed variances to create deep-ball opportunities. Extremely confident and competitive. Bodies up cornerbacks to win contested catches. Believes he can catch every throw and is able to make the circus grab look easy at times. Excellent ball-tracker. Uses force and leverage at break points to help create room out of his cuts. Manipulates coverage with head fakes and stutter-steps. Strong football bloodlines; grandfather played for years as an NFL guard and father was drafted by Giants as fifth-round quarterback in 1990.", A little upright though his routes. Lateral quickness out of breaks underneath provide no early separation. Operated as big slot but could lack separation quickness to open clean throwing windows underneath for NFL quarterbacks. Build-up runner who doesn't seem to eat up the early cushion. Some scouts question ability to be a productive starter as outside receiver. Excessive fakes and jukes into breaks at times; will need to win with more efficient routes. Protracted gear-down getting into breaks for deep comebacks., Round 2-3, Jarvis Landry," Utilized as a slot receiver in college but could transition outside. Produced elite numbers against a lower level of competition but saved a monster game for Washington State early in the season. He is as natural a pass catcher as you will find with desired competitive drive on each snap. His transition to NFL-level cornerbacks will take time, but he has the ability to become an early No. 3 receiver and eventual starter."
Greg Mabin,CB, Gets most out of jam and redirect opportunities. Looks comfortable and competent from bail coverage. Shows better stop-start change of direction laterally than hip tightness would suggest. Stakes a claim with inside leverage and fights to maintain it. Prudent versus double moves and shows some ability to pattern match in that regard. Willing to step downhill and take on his task in run support.," Not a playmaker. Too tall in his backpedal. Hips are stiff and limit his reactive quickness. Short-strider unable to drive hard to the throw once it's out of quarterback's hands. Got his hands on just 3-of-48 targets in senior season. Play speed below average. Hips slow to unlock and open from press coverage, and gets way behind when beaten by early speed. Shows some confusion from zone coverage. Misses too many tackles. Missed end of senior season with a broken bone in lower right leg.", PFA,," Wiry cornerback playing opposite Desmond King was picked on frequently by opponents and struggled to rise to the occasion. Flashes some potential at times, but his lack of recovery speed and lack of coverage versatility could limit his opportunities to make a roster."
Riley Bullough,LB," Football smart and understands his run fits. Willing to play downhill and get dirty. Gets most out of his natural play speed. Will accelerate into contact to maximize his force. Senses running back's shifting path and responds. Makes well-timed leaps to take down perimeter runs before they hit the corner. Reads and responds to quarterback's eyes in space. Snared four interceptions over 2014-15 seasons. Football is in his veins. Along with father (Shane), uncle (Chuck) and brother (Max), Riley is one of four Bullough family members to lead the Spartans in tackles. Max plays for the Texans."," Better junior tape than in 2016. Small for the inside and gets swallowed by size. Uses shoulder-over-hands technique in take-on opportunities. Average athletic ability. Struggles to recover if he overshoots his run fit. Tight hips preclude effective change of direction and short-area burst to close out cutting runners. Too many shoe-string tackle attempts. Stiffer than you like in coverage. Missed three games in 2016 with shoulder injury. Logged three personal fouls in first quarter against Maryland, including ejection for targeting.", PFA, Jared Norris," Tenacity and willingness to play as physically as his body will allow will make him a favorite of special teams coaches, but his lack of size and plus athleticism could make it hard to find playing time, especially as an inside linebacker. He could go on Day 3 (Rounds 4-7), but his road to the roster could be bumpy."
Carl Lawson,OLB," Well-built with good muscular definition. Strong upper body. Has crisp, sharp hands. Able to strike and release to shed tight ends quickly. Aggressive setting edge and works with maxed-out arm extension after punch. Fights through down blocks from tight ends and receivers to string outside runs to the sideline. Could play standing up or with a hand on the ground. Has NFL power and aggressiveness. Explosive get-off with some heat in his feet over first two steps upfield. Good forward lean into his rush. Slaps and chops at tackle's punch to soften the edge. Takes tight, linear track to quarterback with big close-out burst once he turns the corner. Experience rushing from interior-line spot and stand-up inside backer. Finesse tackles will struggle to handle his speed-to-power bursts.", Injuries have side-tracked playing time and production over the years. Missed 2014 with ACL tear and six games in 2015 with hip injury. Face-up rusher who struggles to get hip flip or shoulder turn at the top of his rush. Takes predictable tracks in his pass rushes and gets stuck on blocks. Needs creative rush attack with legitimate counters. Hips are tight and restrictive in lower half. Needs better knee bend throughout the rep. His momentum is sometimes too much to overcome. Washed up and around the arc and unable to drop anchor and take a stand. Poor tackle production. Pursuit is too measured and uneven. Below-average lateral agility limits tackle radius. Too content to ride out the edges he sets rather than looking to eat as tackler., Round 3, Owamagbe Odighizuwa," Linear player with natural power and aggressiveness, but a lack of flexibility could hamper his potential as an NFL rusher. Lawson's twitch shows up in short, controlled bursts, but he struggles to finish if the play isn't right in front of him. Lawson's ruffneck demeanor will appeal to teams looking for an aggressive edge-setter along a physical front, but his draft grade could vary quite a bit from team to team."
Cameron Sutton,CB," Man-cover corner with feet to mirror and match off line of scrimmage. Responsive to route keys from wideouts. Decent instincts looking to jump hitches and wide receiver screens. Desired fluidity of movement with ability to open and run from backpedal. Confident in coverage and rarely penalized. Good acceleration to ball raking across catch point when he gets there. High school wideout with soft hands and smart angles to the ball. Finished career with 37 passes defensed including seven interceptions. Allowed just three touchdowns during career. Praised by coaches for competitive character and selfless, team-first attitude. Worked his tail off to return to field after fracturing ankle in mid-September. Punt-return talent; career average of 14.9 yards with three touchdowns."," Frame needs more muscle. Too passive in press coverage, failing to land solid hands that slow opponent or redirect their routes. Can be bodied around by big wideouts. Plays a little tall in his backpedal. Feet lack some twitch when asked to plant and explode forward from pedal. Has issues with back to the quarterback; late to turn and find the ball, allowing catches over his head. Could struggle to carry long speed down the field. Operates with short arms and small hands. Unreliable in run support with too many side-swipe, grab-and-drag attempts. Missed six games with fractured ankle early in senior season.", Round 3, B.W. Webb," Four-year starter with the fluidity to handle man coverage on the outside, but lacking desired physicality and run-support traits that zone teams covet. Sutton flashed outstanding ball production his first two seasons but saw his per-game production drop since. Could be forced inside due to a lack of size on next level. Punt-return ability could be what gets him on the field first."
Blake Jarwin,TE," Used everywhere -- in-line, as a wing, from the slot, and split wide. Smooth acceleration into routes. Operated underneath for Oklahoma State, but has the athleticism to threaten downfield. Crisp in his route work. Snaps routes off quickly and works back to the throw. Tough over the middle and fights for contested catches. Good flexibility to twist and adjust to throws. Excellent leaper who can go get it. Focus drops from 2015 became catches in 2016. Immediate north-south runner after the catch. Can drag tackles for extra yardage. Instinctive lead blocker who makes good reads. Can adjust to moving targets on second level.", More of a pre-snap squat than a pre-snap stance with legs very wide. Inconsistent blocker when asked to play in-line. Play strength needs work; can be tossed around at point of attack. Needs to activate hands as second-level blocker rather than relying on light shoulder checks. Takes poor angles to edge rushers when asked to pass protect. Lack of getaway burst after the catch limits his playmaking potential. Limited production as pass catcher over last three years., Round 6-7,," Unexciting statistical production belies his potential as a pass-catcher on the next level. He has the necessary athleticism, uncover, and toughness to work both the first and second levels of the defense. Jarwin needs work in the weight room and as a blocker in order to handle reps as an NFL tight end. He has eventual starter potential and should find a spot on a roster as a rotational tight end with the potential to play in-line and on the move."
Johnny Caspers,C, Comes from an offensive line where technique and fundamentals are stressed. Has experience at both guard and center in college. Loads of experience as a pulling guard. Displays footwork necessary to get out of his stance cleanly and into short- and long-pull scenarios. Has improved some in pass protection. Works hard to keep pad level in check. Always looking for work when uncovered in pass protection and will land heavy thud into the ribs of an engaged opponent., Athletic ability is below NFL standards. Clumsy in space. Struggles to adjust to moving targets and too often finds feet out of place when he does get to his target. Has issues gathering himself and coming to balance even on short pulls. Becomes the nail rather than the hammer due to lack of first-strike success. Missing the footwork and balance to consistently make cutoff blocks on the second level. Fails to consistently make centered contact and defenders slide out of his clutches. Head-ducker into his pass punch and takes too long to find looper into his gap after passing off initial twister. Hand placement is awful at times., UDFA,," Caspers is a determined worker with a reputation for getting after it in the weight room, but he might lack the athletic ability and overall talent to become a starter in the league. While a move from guard to center could help him somewhat, he might need to find his way into a camp via the undrafted free agent route."
Amara Darboh,WR," Good NFL size with above-average arm length. Experience in Michigan's pro-style passing attack. Saw increase in targets and responded with improved production. In 2016, had at least one catch of at least 30 yards in eight of first nine games, outplaying highly regarded teammate Jehu Chesson. Fluid working two-way releases from slot. Smooth transitions in his routes. Won't give away plant-and-go cuts to the post, allowing him to stay ahead of the cornerback. Heady player. Adjusts routes to create better throwing opportunities for quarterbacks. Accepts responsibility as blocker climbing up to cornerbacks with some urgency of engagement. Able to sustain his block when run play flows his way. Locks up back-side safety blocks.", Build-up runner who is slow to eat up cornerback cushion. Play speed appears to be average. Missing suddenness and twitch. Inconsistent release quickness against press. Could struggle to uncover against aggressive man coverage. Gradual sink into breaks alerts cornerbacks to slam on breaks and challenge the throw. Body catcher. Ball will beat him up and he suffers from focus drops. Needs to improve positioning against defensive backs. Rarely escapes a spirited tackle attempt. Not very dynamic after the catch., Round 3-4, Mohamed Sanu," Darboh caught the attention of scouts from very early on in his final season at Michigan. Darboh's outstanding size will have some teams excited, but he needs to run well at the combine in order to be targeted as a ""size/speed"" prospect. He lacks the quickness and hands to make a living underneath, but has the physical traits and willingness to help as a blocker that could get teams to bite on the second day of the draft (Rounds 2-3). Scheme fit could determine whether he becomes a WR2 or just a guy fighting for snaps off the bench."
Vince Biegel,LB," Voted team captain. Known for intensity and all-out love for the sport. Instinctive. Diagnoses zone blocks quickly and darts through gaps into backfield to muddy backside cutback lanes. Works to keep outside shoulder uncovered for contain responsibilities against the run. Emotional leader for the Badgers. Wrap-up tackler looking to thud. Flashes desired pursuit speed to perimeter. First-strike specialist at point of attack. Lands hands first and immediate arm extension provides leverage against much bigger blockers. Adequate hip flexibility and change of direction to mirror play-action rollouts. Good run-pass recognition. Was asked to peel off and cover in space. Squeezes receivers from zone. Posted productive rush totals over sophomore and junior seasons. Father, uncle, grandfather and younger brother all played college ball."," Undersized, and it often shows up on tape. Needs to increase play strength and add more bulk to his frame. Gets jostled around by tackles if he loses with his hands. Poor contact balance to fight through redirect blocks and can get shoved to turf. Average three-step burst upfield. Duck-foot rusher missing twitch and athleticism to bend the edge. Attempts to activate spin counter, but he's missing footwork to bring it home. ""Take-on"" anchor and power versus lead blockers is below average. Quick to stack, slow to shuck.", Rounds 5-6, Frank Zombo," Effort-based worker bee with edge-setting hands and attitude, but a lack of power that could lead to inconsistency in play. Biegel's football character is off-the-charts and he can be counted on to put the effort into improving in areas that need work. He lacks individual rush talent but could be a good fit for teams utilizing exotic rush packages. Average NFL ceiling but has the demeanor and traits of a potential special teams demon."
Chunky Clements,DT, Strikes with power in his initial charge. Times snap and shoots into neutral zone with some quickness. Active and aggressive with hands and club moves. Finds his way into the gaps. Not a content pass rusher. Works to improve positioning and tries to find blocker's edge. Ties a basketball Euro-step with arm-over move to climb over top of guard. Active tackler for interior player. Forced three fumbles over final two seasons at Illinois.," Short-stepper. Not fluid when moving laterally. Complete waste of time gaming him up front with twists. Counter moves in short supply. Once he gets behind in the rep, he rarely fights back into the play. Plays upright. Pad level gets him redirected out of gap and past tackle opportunities. Lacks the leverage and anchor to handle double-teams.", Round 7-PFA,," Penetrating three-technique tackle on the next level with some moldable pass-rush traits. Clements will always struggle to withstand NFL power at the point of attack unless he improves his pad level and overall anchor, but he might be able to flash enough to find a spot on a practice squad."
Zach Banner,OT, Massive man with good upper-body strength. Has length and girth to overwhelm smaller opponents. Able to withstand a bull rush thanks to enormous frame. Powerful road-grader who blasts holes open as down-blocker and generates movement with his base blocks. Leverage not always necessary to produce push at point of attack. Won't find him on the ground much. Decent athlete for his size. Functional combo blocker. Initial kick-slide is fairly smooth. Can make life miserable for pass rushers when he latches strong hands into their frame. Could play right tackle but would need help against edge speed. Balance and redirect are adequate.," Weight concerns are a huge issue. Has seen weight balloon to 385 pounds. Pass pro is a major concern. Could be too big and bulky to handle NFL edge talent. Lacks athleticism and quickness to recover when beaten. Slower than desired out of stance. Has to open early and lunge to protect the edge in pass pro. Rarely flat-footed at punch, relying on girth over technique. Takes wide route to his target with punch. Doesn't mirror well enough to keep defender from escaping from side door once engaged. Lack of bend and high center of gravity could make move to guard a challenge. Has had issues with penalties during time as starter at USC.", Rounds 3-4, Trent Brown," Rare size, but some teams will question whether he can bend enough to be a functional NFL guard. As a tackle, he lacks quickness to consistently protect the passer, and teams might focus too heavily on that shortcoming. Teams who focus on Banner's strength -- drive blocking -- should be rewarded with a starting right guard who is average in pass protection, but who can help turn run creases into running lanes."
Tyvis Smith,RB, Possesses good size for the position. Has decent vision and generally makes good reads before cutting. Shows off necessary footwork to elude darting defenders shooting into the backfield. Athletic. Will leap up and over would-be tacklers in open field. Dependable pass catcher out of backfield. Sees blitzes and twists and moves to pick them up in pass protection. Has desired size to protect quarterback on third downs., Play speed is lacking. Runs at one speed with a lack of functional burst to consistently escape the clutches of first-level tacklers. Unable to accelerate to the corner and threaten the edge. Average route runner out of backfield and isn't much of a threat post-catch. Too often taps break over hitting gas before contact into tacklers. Below-average acceleration and takes awhile to gear up after gathering himself. Doesn't run with much bend and will takes on big hits., UDFA,," While he played at the same school and has similar size to David Johnson, Smith doesn't possess Johnson's ability as a rusher or production at the position. As a running back, his lack of quickness and physicality will hurt his chances of being drafted, but his size and ability to factor into third downs gives him a chance to get into a camp."
Steven Taylor,ILB," Has four years of starting experience with time spent at both inside and outside linebacker spots. Consistent in his tackle production. Very effective, sneaky blitzer. Has feel for the timing of the blitz. Sees blockers moving angles and finds his way to the quarterback. Uses hands well on the move, discarding blockers and positioning himself for the tackle. Soft hands when ball is thrown his way. Shows an ability to turn offenses over with fumbles forced and interceptions."," Duck-footed with heavy-legged pursuit to the ball. Not a cut-up, twitchy athlete. Too small for the interior. Takes time to ramp up to top speed after change of direction. Missing top gear to run sideline to sideline as an NFL linebacker. Allows his fundamentals to slip when fatigued. Plays too upright and with narrow base at times. Displays below-average contact balance when taking on blocks at an angle.", UDFA,," Experienced linebacker who has been moved around the field and who has shown an ability to get to the quarterback when asked to blitz. He lacks the twitch to be a full-time pass rusher and the baseline size and speed that defensive coordinators usually want from an inside linebacker. Taylor won't shy away from the physicality needed to play the position, but might have to prove himself as a special teams demon in order to have a shot at making a roster."
Sean Harlow,OG," Grinder who gives good effort in double teams and down blocks. Sinks hips into initial contact at point of attack. Plays with decent hand strength. Has some natural upper-body power. Able to lock-out and stalemate against power as base blocker. Keeps feet driving once he locks onto second-level foes. Looks to finish his blocks. Has taken multiple practice reps at center. Has experience at both tackle spots. Father, Pat, was an all-american offensive tackle at USC and a first-round pick of New England Patriots in 1991.", Has short arms and operates with low hands pre-punch. Sluggish with eyes and feet. Gets behind in his blocks too often. Plodding feet create inefficient routes to his block. Legs straighten out after contact as run blocker. Struggles to control run blocks with hands due to lack of length. Bull-rushed the entire game by much smaller edge rushers. Struggles to drop anchor and fight back; could see the same results with move inside., Round 5-6,," Lacks the length and athletic ability to play tackle at the next level and will have to kick inside. Shows some power at the point of attack, but needs to play with better bend after initial contact. Will be a little limited in space and his anchor problems as a left tackle will have to be vetted in pre-draft workouts after he kicks inside. Could be a serviceable backup with swing ability between center and guard."
Marquez White,CB, Spies quarterback from quarters coverage and drives early to underneath routes. Shows good awareness of routes around him. Willing to overlap his coverage responsibilities from off-man. Long arms and big hands. Jams with quick reaction time post-snap. Looks to land punch on inside shoulder. Crowds the outside release. Held opponents to completion percentage of just 32.1 percent in 2015. Allowed just one touchdown over last two seasons as field corner.," Skinny and plays with a narrow base throughout the rep. Obvious balance issues transitioning from press into his turn. Lacks patience from press. Opens to first fake he sees. Tall, stiff backpedal. Gives away inside leverage, allowing open throwing windows. Poor career ball production with just 11 passes defensed. Slow to get head around to find ball. Delayed stick-and-click burst forward from backpedal. Waits on running backs to bring action to him. Allowed total of eight missed and broken tackles four to just 22 total tackles this season.", Round 7-PFA,," Finesse cornerback with limited ball skills and production as two-year starter. Coverage stats from junior season garnered attention, but his 2016 tape was average, with marginal instincts and coverage inconsistencies from press. Length is a plus and he does have talent, but he needs technique work to iron out some issues."
Hardy Nickerson,LB," Always looking to play downhill. Is willing to take chances and shoot the gaps to make a play. Energetic and always plays as hard as he possibly can. Productive tackler, posting more than 100 tackles in each of his last two college seasons. Scrapes with square pads and good quickness. Has only allowed three broken tackles over his four years of football. Willing to fling himself into a gap and sacrifice his body against pulling guards and iso-blocking fullbacks. Father was one of the NFL's most menacing inside linebackers in his day."," Struggles to disengage from big tight ends, and even wide receivers have had some success blocking him. Play strength must increase. Instincts are below average. Can be slow to read and react and will run himself out of his run fits more than he should. Herky-jerky and plays with excessive wasted motion post-snap. Takes inconsistent angles to the ball, which gets him beat in run game and in coverage. Submarines iso blocks on the edge of the run lane rather than the middle of the hole.", Round 7-PFA,," Nickerson is a try-hard WILL linebacker in a 4-3 defensive front who might lack the instincts and consistency to make an NFL team. While the tackle production is solid, third day (Rounds 4-7) draft pick and special teams performer could be his ceiling. Based off the tape, making an NFL roster could be difficult."
Kyle Kalis,OG, Well-schooled in technique and works hard to play with good fundamentals. Hands in punch-ready position in pass sets. Looks to control defender's shoulder with his hands and generally lands an accurate strike. Operates with sturdy base and good balance. Utilizes flat-backed posture through his pass sets. Understands his assignments and follows them against blitzes and twists. Maintains desired base and posture throughout most pass sets. Has enough natural strength to withstand a strong bull-rusher.," Might be playing with a base that is too wide. Wide base and upright pad level generates very little push as a drive blocker. Stiff throughout his lower body and operates with pounding, heavy feet. Pops straight up and takes restricted slow steps when pulling or when climbing to second level. Successful cut-off blocks on the second level will be a rarity in the pros. Forced to lean and lunge to try and redirect gap shooters due to slow feet. Must play in a phone booth rather than in space.", Round 7-PFA,," Good size and length and is a smart guard with above average technique. However, his leg stiffness and lack of functional athleticism will be extremely challenging to overcome. At best he has a shot at being drafted late on Day 3, and will almost certainly find his way into an NFL training camp at worst."
James Quick,WR," Can secure inside release for post routes through clever set-up on release. Runs routes with consistent purpose and urgency. Varies speed of route to create man-made ""burst"" within his trek. Route salesman. Generates distress in cover safeties with route work. Utilizes body lean and believable head fakes to create hip commitment from defenders. Quick getting upfield after catch to maximize the play. Tracks the deep throw and adjusts rapidly to underthrows. Subtle route adjustments in space to avoid redirection from zone linebackers. Cover experience on special teams early in career."," Small, thin target. Unlikely catch-and-run option on next level. Too small to fight through tackles after catch. Quicker than fast. Has some build-up speed, but might not be fast enough to threaten aggressive corners looking to squat on routes. Stiff hands can be unforgiving. Finished career with 19 drops against 123 catches. Has focus-drop issues but also struggles to finish catches that are outside his frame. Needs to do better job of working aggressively back to throws. Route separation comes through route work over acceleration from breaks.", PFA,, Slot corner with average athleticism and quickness and below-average hands. History of drops combined with his thin frame are likely indicators of issues with contested catches on the next level. Will measure shorter than his listed height so he might need a big 40 time to increase his odds of going any earlier than late Day 3 in the draft.
Kyle Fuller,C," Excellent size and length for the position. Arms over 34 inches long. Has frame to counter big nose guards. Snaps and immediately broadens base in pass pro. Uses efficient path to punch with hands, shooting straight to target with desired placement. Can stalemate and neutralize interior rushers with combination of length and anchor. Has hips to create some initial pop at impact. Good strength in hands."," Below-average athletic ability. Combination blocks are a struggle. Stays glued to secure block and allows linebacker to cross his face before making contact on the climb. Below-average movement skills hidden by Baylor offense. Takes poor angles on second level and has poor redirect skills in space. Needs guard help to generate push. Often strikes from unbalanced platform, causing contact imbalance. Hands and feet not synched.", Round 6-7,," Below-average athleticism and body control hinder his effectiveness, but he has the physical traits that teams will likely look to mold. Has enough anchor that he can neutralize at the point of attack, but he probably won't be much of a block winner in the future. He won't fit in schemes that require plus athleticism from the center, but it's conceivable he could become an eventual starter based on his attributes."
Kareem Hunt,RB, Compact body with broad frame and muscular legs. Above-average agility for his size. Has hips and feet to elude darting defenders in backfield. Uses effective jump-cut to avoid the sludge and shift to the open gap. Runs with good vision and overall instincts. Presses the line before making back-side cuts. Conforms his run to changing space within running lane. Spin moves are effective against first-look tacklers on second level. Suddenly shifts to bounce an inside run to the perimeter. Strings moves together on outside zone plays. Runs with knee bend and forward lean. Adequate pass catcher for screens and check-downs.," Can elude initial tackle but struggles to accelerate after redirecting his feet. Average explosion traits. Marginal downhill burst through line of scrimmage. Inconsistent inside runner. Gets too cute in the hole when run comes to a close. Looks to spin rather than finish with authority. Needs to run to his size more consistently. Premature in breaking off play-side runs in outside zone. He might not trust his play speed. Slight gear-down into downhill cuts. Could struggle to find chunk runs on next level. Chip ""leans"" rather than chip blocks allowing open rib shots to go unclaimed.", Round 3, Olandis Gary, Big back with plus vision and enough elusiveness to make the first defender miss. Feel for the rushing lane helps him choose the correct path between the tackles but lacks the burst to turn the 4-yard run into 14. Zone-scheme runner with serviceable hands out of the backfield. Adequate in most areas and has talent to become a backup that can step in and handle a bigger load if needed.
Jahad Thomas,RB," Possesses plus play. Shows burst both around the corner on the play-side as well as out of his cuts. Vision extends beyond what's in front of him, finding linebackers early and reacting to their flow. Choppy footwork allows for quick cutting in tight spaces. Has experience in a pro-style rushing attack. Excellent pass catcher. Able to line up in slot and create separation as a receiver. Able to create yards after catch with his speed. Has ability to help out as kick or punt returner. Voted to wear single-digit number by teammates, which indicates toughness inside Temple program."," Small and spindly. When he takes a solid shot, the run stops almost immediately. Has logged very few broken tackles as he's unable to generate necessary power in his lower half. Struggles to play with consistent balance through contact. Runs more upright than expected. Could benefit from more efficient usage of a stiff-arm with his off hand. At times, will decelerate into contact. Is a willing pass protector but just not big or strong enough to do so consistently.", PFA, Marcus Murphy," Productive running back lacking in NFL-caliber size and strength but who makes up for it with his quickness and ability to help as a pass catcher and return man. While it's hard to imagine him handling more than just a few carries per game as an NFL runner, his roster flexibility could work in his advantage. With his ability to operate from the slot and as a jet-sweep runner, he could be an interesting toy for a creative play-caller."
Jylan Ware,OT," Athletic with decent movement skills. Flexible and comes off the ball with good pad level. Makes contact at leveraged angles. Can roll hips through defender after contact and generate some push in run game. Once he's locked in, will pump his feet. Understands his length. Able to keep defenders off of him with long arms and plus hand placement inside the frame. Impressive strength in his large hands. Can snatch and maintain engagement to jersey/pads of his opponent. Decent balance in pass sets with well-timed punch. Rarely shoots hands unless pass rusher is in range. Appears to have foot quickness and agility to handle edge rushers."," Needs to add muscle and overall bulk to his frame. Could struggle initially against speed-to-power pass rushers. Doesn't always bring his feet with him after contact, causing balance inconsistencies when trying to maintain his run blocks. Inconsistent footwork in pass sets. Gets caught mid-gallop at times and can be knocked off-balance. Opens up a little too early in his slides. Needs a more flat-footed punch approach. Played a lower level of competition. Needs to quicken speed of hand usage to match NFL speed he will see. Noticeably late out of his stance too often.", Round 7-PFA, Jermey Parnell," A prospect with the traits and athleticism to potentially advance more quickly than others with the developmental label. While his pass sets need work, he seems to have a good feel for how to use his long arms and strong hands. He will need time to add more bulk to his frame to handle bull-rushers, but he has some tools and might have a future in the NFL with more experience and coaching."
Jourdan Lewis,CB," Ultra-competitive with an overwhelming drive to succeed. Allowed just seven catches in 2016 for completion percentage against of 23.3. An annoyance from press coverage. Squats on top of his target waiting to punch and impede. Twitchy feet can stick and close to ball instantly when he reads pass. Able to flip hips and accelerate quickly. Has lateral quickness and agility to flourish from the slot. Has adequate recovery speed to make up for an early mistake. Finds ball with back to quarterback as well as anyone in college. Maintains tight coverage downfield and waits for receiver's eyes to cue him in on when to turn and find it. In three years as a starter, credited with 42 passes defensed, including six interceptions. Allowed just two touchdowns during same time frame. Showed off ball skills and athleticism with highlight reel, one-handed interception against Wisconsin. Has special teams experience as a gunner and in return game.", Diminutive frame. Limited in coverage options due to matchup concerns against elite NFL size. Has to work overtime to disengage from physical wideouts in run support. Tape shows small delay in reaction when attempting to mirror an inside release. Tendency to grab if beaten early off the line. Penalized 14 times over career with eight pass interferences. Will allow his man a head start past him when he starts reckless eyeballing the quarterback from off coverage. Might lack necessary spring to win 50-50 balls at the high point., Rounds 6-7, Adam Jones," Technician with the foot quickness and overall athleticism to handle himself from the slot. Shouldn't be much of a detriment against the run for teams who want to attack on the ground from 11 personnel. Excels from press and plays with confidence and edge. Lack of size will scare some teams and could cause him to fall out of the first round, but he has the ability to become a very good slot corner for a man-cover team. His draft projection is based on a pending legal issue."
Jerry Ugokwe,OT," Good-looking on the hoof with NFL frame and length. Makes use of his long arms and big hands. Plays with good foot quickness in his initial, lateral movement. Has ability to reach three-techniques with more coaching. Athletic enough to secure, climb and locate moving targets. Displays a nasty streak and looks to finish blocks with some attitude. Can be a nuisance to pass rushers when he strikes first and locks those long arms out in pass protection. Has experience at both tackle spots. Outstanding intelligence and moldable prospect."," Might need additional work and time to be able to catch up with the jump in talent he'll see at pro level. Doesn't always take the smart angle against twists and allows his protection to become leaky at times. Too often stiff-legged at contact in his pass sets, allowing open door for bull-rushers to create instant push. Plays with narrow base as drive blocker. Will lunge at the top of the pass rush arc rather than relying on technique. Needs to bring feet with him on angle blocks in order to maintain better contact balance.", Rounds 6-7, Jamon Meredith," Didn't pick up the sport until his junior year of high school but has shown rapid growth over the last three years. While there is a lack of consistency in his technique at this time, he has the traits and potential that should provide offensive line coaches with enough ammo to correct his issues. If he can play with more consistent bend and a wider base, he has interesting developmental potential, but he will likely require a patient approach."
C.J. Beathard,QB," Played in pro-style passing attack, working under center and from shotgun. Capable and confident rolling out. Squares shoulders to deliver strikes. Completed 57 percent of his passes outside of the pocket at Iowa. Showed improved touch on short throws. Footwork and pocket mechanics look solid. Throws with some natural accuracy despite pedestrian completion percentage. Better tape in 2015 as he had to overcome injuries to key targets in 2016. Has the arm strength to throw the deep out without laboring. Trusts his line and keeps eyes downfield. Plays with relatively calm demeanor. Good feel and timing for screen game. Knee brace slowed him some during senior season, but he has ability to escape the heat. Team leader with ability to handle adversity. Won't take unnecessary chances."," Hesitation is a noticeable issue. Often late to pull trigger on throws toward the sideline, forcing receivers into boundary and out of the catch. Slow field scanner who tends to lock into a single side. Too much eye-balling and not enough manipulating. Poor feel for pocket pressure. Two-year sack total of 58 is too high in play-action attack. Anchors deep in pocket and rarely climbs pocket to safe harbor. Oblivious to backside pressure until it's too late. Needs more air under the long ball. Deep-ball accuracy has been terrible. Completed under 30 percent of throws beyond 20 yards in last two seasons at Iowa. Completed just 43 percent of throws beyond line of scrimmage to right sideline.", Rounds 6-7, Tom Savage," Pro-style quarterback who dealt with nagging injuries to key pass catchers and himself in 2016. His 2015 tape was more impressive, but deep-ball accuracy issues, poor pocket awareness, and unnecessary hesitation as a passer shows up in both seasons. Beathard plays checkers with safeties rather than chess, which could always hinder his ability to attack down the field with success. Could be a career backup who finds himself in the action at some point down the road."
Jamaal Clayborn,C, Girthy with good lower body mass. Able to process movement across from him quickly and make adjustments. Always looking for work when uncovered. Has experience at both guard and center. Uses all of his wide frame in pass protection., Snap-to-step quickness is below average. Unable to unlock quickly enough with lateral movement to get to his reach blocks. Plays with poor pad level. Is too upright too often and finds himself on the wrong end of the leverage battle on most reps. Plodding movement as run blocker or when asked to mirror in pass pro. Hands can be painfully slow., UDFA,," Looks the part when squatting over the ball in preparation to snap, but once the ball is snapped there just aren't enough plus plays. His battle is often lost with slow hand placement that allows defenders to get into his frame early in the rep and he doesn't have the bend or athletic ability to overcome. His lack of winning-play attributes could make it hard to hear his name called during the draft."
Jalen Reeves-Maybin,LB," Early responder after the snap. Loves to play downhill and is always headed in that direction when necessary. Will not hesitate to take a chance and shoot a gap. Uniquely instinctive. Will rarely get trapped too far downhill that he can't bounce out of the side door to chase when needed. Plays square and shifts and shuffles to his run fits. Easy, fluid chaser with desired flexibility in lower body for sudden change of direction. Runs well and can chase in coverage. Has burst to ball carrier as tackler. Can spring quickly into action with bounce and explosion as lateral tackler from one gap to the next. Has coverage talent. Outstanding eyes. Somehow manages to find ball carrier through all the visual trash. Stalks with patience and calm. Productive special-teams tackler."," Lacks size and pop to stop runners in their tracks and often takes brunt of initial impact. Needs to run feet through impact to prevent sliding off his tackles. Forced to give away gap leverage to avoid being devoured by big, climbing linemen in run game. Scouts say he appears to have lost functional weight while injured. Was lost for season after first four games due to injury and subsequent surgery to shoulder. Injury history with shoulder is a substantial concern.", Round 6-7,," My preseason grade on Reeves-Maybin was a 5.66, but he has very little wiggle room for medical concerns considering his lack of size. In a vacuum, he has the instincts, athletic ability and cover talent of a starting, three-down linebacker. If he regains full health he could be a steal, but he might need another year of rehab work and working with strength coaches to bulk up to NFL standards."
James Onwualu,LB, Former receiver who switched to defense after freshman season. Has quick feet and can cover in space. Twitched-up athlete with plus reactive quickness against the pass and run. Reads quarterback's eyes and breaks hard on throw with sharp closing burst. Deflected three passes in 2016 Stanford game. Mentally tough. Responds well after a bad rep. Team captain his senior season. Scouts label him as selfless and great teammate. Can open hips and change direction smoothly. Worked hard in off-season to refine body type to become a better player. Has background as special teams standout early in his career., Undersized for the position and looks more like a big strong safety. Can be engulfed and thwarted by size. Will struggle to disengage from NFL power. Utilized as pass rusher and blitzer in college but lacks the frame to convert speed to power as a pro. Play strength near line of scrimmage is below average. Talent to play on first and second down is in question., Round 7-PFA,," A weakside, 4-3 linebacker who has the go-go motor and fearless, attacking spirit that gives him a chance to make a roster as a special teams performer with backup LB ability. As a former receiver, Onwualu has the foot quickness and ability to make plays on the ball in coverage. He has a chance to get drafted on the third day (Rounds 4-7), but his path to a roster spot definitely lies with his special teams potential."
Erik Magnuson,OG," Has starting experience at both guard and tackle. Solid athlete with loose hips and good lateral movement. Average feet but a clean, smooth kick slide. Understands his angles as a zone blocker and will give ground to gain ground on his cut-blocks. Patient on reach blocks and waits until feet are in position before locking up. Can adjust in space to connect with moving targets. Dependable in space. Decent block engagement. Operates with capable mirroring ability in pass protection. Has the balance and footwork necessary to redirect his weight back inside against stunts and counter moves."," Shorter than his listed height and legs look a little bit sawed off. Might not have the length to play tackle or the strength to play guard. Play strength is below average. Power plays shake free of him too quickly. Could struggle to seal and maintain his blocks on the next level. Needs to find more strength in his hands. His pass-punch is slow and tentative, operating as a catch mechanism more than a warning shot. Bends at the waist in some pass sets. Gets behind in his pass sets and struggles to find the redirect power around the rush arc for a clean recovery.", PFA,," A tackle at Michigan his last two seasons there, but lack of length and power could necessitate a move into center or back at guard for a zone-scheme team. Movement skills make him a fit for teams looking to operate in space, but he will have to prove he has the functional strength necessary to hold up inside in the NFL."
Desmond King,S," Four-year starter and ultimate iron man. Played in more than 94 percent of Iowa's defensive snaps over his four years and took 46 percent of the special teams snaps in 2016. Football instincts are off the charts. Focused quarterback reader who overlaps into other coverage areas to go make a play on the ball. Pattern reader with anticipation to keep him ahead of the route. Creates unique angles to throws, allowing for top-ball production. Obsessed with getting the ball; nabbed 14 interceptions in college and 29 in high school. Has ball-tracking, hands and high-point talent of a wideout. Stocky frame with physical play demeanor. Good press strength. Rough on slot receivers who can't make a quick get-away off the line. Viable option as both punt and kick returner. Not overly physical as tackler but tends to finish."," Lacks long speed and height associated with bump and run cornerbacks. Struggles to carry receivers down the field. Can be mismatched by legitimate speed merchants. Grinder who lacks mirror-and-match fluidity and foot quickness. Relies on hands usage and grabbing over footwork to transition and match on intermediate routes. In press, can get behind when facing off against slick releases from slot weapons. Lacks recovery speed to consistently close open throwing windows on NFL level. Penalized 11 times, including five personal fouls, over final two seasons. Needs to show more explosion into tackles and improve wrap-up technique.", Round 3, Jairus Byrd," Lack of size and speed combined with his ball skills, instincts, and competitiveness all point to a transition to safety. While he can improve as a tackler, he's got the toughness and mentality to take on run-support duties. Can cover in man when asked and has the ball-tracking skills and anticipation that should allow him to thrive in two-deep and single-high situations. A likely second-day (Rounds 2-3) selection and could be targeted as a zone corner or a safety with early starting potential."
Daniel Brunskill,OT," Very good athlete for the position. Has the footwork and twitch to switch from block to block in opposite gaps. Excellent radar on second level with ability to find and land making his secure block. Has initial burst out of stance with potential to cross-face on NFL level. Flexible and agile. Improving with arm extension at punch. Has feet to mirror edge speed. Diverse athlete in high school with a background in wrestling, lacrosse and volleyball. Tremendous student with work ethic teams want."," Needs to eat and lift until he can grow into the rigors of tackle position. Lacks functional strength in lower body at this time. Play strength will be a work in progress for the very near future. Base too narrow as drive blocker, generating little push. Down blocks end in stalemates. Hands catch rather than punch. Gives his frame away and is susceptible to bull rush. Will lean to try and create his power.", Round 7-PFA,," Intriguing athletic ability for the tackle spot, but will need time on a practice squad for additional schooling and weight work to get his skill and size where it needs to be. Teams could decide to use him as a big blocking tight end, but his best shot to make it in the NFL will likely be as a tackle for a zone-scheme team."
Dan Skipper,OT," Very tall for the position with decent functional athleticism. Has experience starting at both tackle spots. Has operated in a pro-style rushing attack and has experience firing off the ball and working with guards. Decent timing with his pass-pro punch. Can pull and is able to operate in space as a run blocker. While not always fluid with it, shows ability to transition from first to second block. Intelligent and aware of his responsibilities against twists."," At times, height works against him due to lack of anchor. Is consistently jolted by power players at first punch. Will default to wide, engulfing hands in pass protection, which opens his chest to bull-rushers. Rarely able to get his pad level into leveraged position due to center of gravity. Missing leg drive to consistently pop and secure his down blocks. Hand placement is spotty and he lacks power in them. As run blocker, will be unable to turn NFL defenders out of the hole with footwork and technique.", Rounds 6-7,," Size will be appealing to some NFL teams as will his experience at both tackle positions. His experience in Arkansas' physical rushing attack should work in his favor, but he lacks the sand in his pants to consistently match power with power against bigger, NFL-caliber talent at the point of attack. The same height that will intrigue some teams might ultimately rob Skipper of the necessary leverage he needs at the next level. Could project as a third-day (Rounds 4-7) swing tackle prospect who will have to battle to win a roster spot."
Keionta Davis,DE," Good build in his lower half with a thick bubble. Frame is compact and powerful. Better arm length than expected. Has upper body strength to press out his punch and create separation with arm extension. Power to set a strong edge was too much for tackles in his conference. Has a good engine and is worker bee through his rep. Heavy tackler who lands chest-first. Built low to the ground and can leverage his way through re-direct blocks. Willing to do dirty work within the scheme to help open the door for teammates to make a play. Plays with quick, efficient hands. Excellent production.", Lacks desired flexibility in lower body. Stiffness leads to shorter strides and a lack of range. Marginal reactive quickness and closing burst. Unable to crash down the line and catch downhill running backs in the backfield. Slow to unlock hips when changing direction. Square rusher who will be unable to get the hip turn or upper body torque slip around the edge as an NFL rusher. Lacks twitch for sudden burst necessary on his inside rush counters. Has issues dealing with long-armed tackles who get on top of him early. Rarely challenged by NFL tackles., Rounds 6-7,," Davis is well built with adequate power at the point of attack and outstanding college production, but he may lack the twitch and fluidity in space to make his mark as an edge player. He has some play traits that could make him an upfield three-technique if he could pile on enough weight, but he doesn't appear to have a clean position fit. He does, however, have enough ability to find his way onto a roster if a team has a plan for him."
Cordrea Tankersley,CB," Angular build with good length. Looks to harass and smother receiver for as long as he can. Runs with access to a second gear when needed. Two-year starter with experience in a variety of coverages. Disruptive at the catch point using full arm extension to maximize his length. Ball production was very good; had eight interceptions in just two years as a starter. Shut down Virginia Tech's Bucky Hodges in conference championship game, holding him to one catch and grabbing two interceptions. Soft hands will pluck it out of the air if he gets into position. Gets desired depth in Cover-2 responsibilities, balancing between high and low. Comes to balance and squares up as a tackler. Looks to tackle low and springs into ball carriers with aggressive shoulder aimed at their thighs.", Anticipation and instincts slightly below average. Eyes are unsure and can be slow to process and react. Lacks bend in his backpedal and bail techniques. Struggles to sink and redirect quickly for transitions forward against comeback routes. Allows too much route separation from off coverage and will need to squeeze tighter on next level. Balance concerns in coverage. Feet and hips can be clunky when it's time to open and run out of press shuffle. Will panic when he gets behind on vertical routes and starts to grab. Had eight pass-interference calls against him in two season. Inconsistent in finding the ball when back is to the quarterback. Needs to add more muscle to frame., Round 3-4, Dre Kirkpatrick," Has an impressive body of work as a lockdown, boundary cornerback but he has some holes in his transitions that could open the door for more separation on the next level. While he's not always the most fluid in coverage, his 6-foot-1 frame and eight interceptions will be the two numbers some teams will focus heavily on. If he runs well at pre-draft workouts, his stock could soar thanks to his size and production."
Channing Stribling,CB, Has a long frame and understands how to use it. Drapes himself over wide receivers off the line of scrimmage. Excels when playing with inside leverage. Can smother receivers against the sideline and is able to challenge sight lines for quarterbacks on comeback routes. Has some talent in trail coverage. Comfortable with back to the quarterback and shows good pattern recognition from that coverage technique. Well-versed in finding and tracking the deep ball. Uses length and leaping ability to create a wall between the throw and the receiver down the field. Soft hands; snared six interceptions over last two seasons. Willing tackler who sees what he hits and looks to wrap up.," Needs more upper body strength. Sluggish change of direction due to marginal short-area quickness. Struggles to mirror sharp, in-breaking routes and clever releases. Has a hitch in movement when opening hips to run, allowing receivers a stagger start into routes. Long strider with poor recovery speed. A little handsy down the field to make up for speed deficiency. Has issues squeezing routes from off coverage and zone. Lack of quickness leaves little room for error.", Rounds 6-7,," Linear press corner who took advantage of newly-found playing time and produced results. While he has NFL length, his long speed is problematic and he struggles to maintain coverage against quick receivers who work inside the numbers. There are defenses who will prefer Stribling's physical traits and ball skills, but he will be limited by scheme fit."
Cooper Rush,QB," Started all but three games during career and was team captain his junior and senior seasons. Defined by cerebral approach. Has bachelor of science degree in actuarial science off-the-field and masters in full-field reads on the field. Juggernaut in film room. Hits the field with well-conceived plans of attack based on his studies. Makes all the pre-snap decisions rather than looking to sideline. Quick processor able to scan and decide rapidly. Interceptions rarely the result of poor decisions. Overcomes arm deficiencies with outstanding timing and accuracy. Anticipatory thrower with feel for developing windows. Able to lead receivers on crossing routes and long balls and can throw receivers open underneath. Very good natural accuracy. Completion percentage penalized by excessive drop totals. Good pocket poise. Climbs pocket with eyes downfield when heat comes around the corners and can slide left or right before delivering accurate strikes. Has history from under center in play-action, pro-style attack and works all three levels of the field. Dump-downs are only a final option."," Frumpy body with very little muscular definition. Does not look the part. Slow, plodding setup in the pocket. Throws from narrow platform and generates very little drive on his throws from lower half. Lollipop arm strength allows ball to hang in air too long. Defensive backs with twitch have time to dart into passing lane and make interceptions despite a good read by quarterback. Struggles to challenge tight windows in middle of the field. Could be limited to timing-based passing attacks. Unable to make sudden getaways from pocket due to lack of athleticism. Strong pocket push from interior short circuits his plans.", PFA, Kellen Moore," His body type and lack of functional arm strength will immediately make him a draft reject on some team's boards, but that could be a mistake. Processes as quickly as any quarterback I've studied over the last five years and has the anticipation and accuracy to counter his lack of velocity. Mental makeup and consistency of production make him a legitimate NFL roster candidate."
Elijah McGuire,RB, Compact frame with good thickness in legs. Runs with good ball security. Very athletic with plus acceleration. Runs with forward lean and has strong burst through the hole when he sees it. Plant-and-go runner. Able to cut it back two gaps away. Build-up speed to the corner seems to fool linebackers who think they have the angle. Has some subtle wiggle approaching line of scrimmage. Excellent hand-eye coordination as pass catcher. Effective from the slot and into routes.," Drops head, causing him to lose sight heading into the hole. Poor feel for spacing of the running lane. Runs too close to defensive linemen when open area is available. Lacks desired downhill toughness. Has no jump cut for optimal elusiveness. Lateral cuts driven by outside foot and lacks width. Will run up blocker's back when there is still yardage to be had. Gives into tackles. Never finished with more than five broken tackles in a single season. Arm tackles throw him off his path. Pass protection needs work.", Round 6-7,," Has decent size, speed and athleticism, but right now he's a better athlete than running back. His vision is okay, but he is simply too quick to give up on runs rather than competing at a high level. His production fell sharply this past season thanks to a foot injury, but his weaknesses transcend any injuries. He has developmental traits that could land him at the back end of a roster or on a practice squad."
Collin Bevins,DE," Extremely long arms with enormous hands. Lands heavy, upward-striking blows to blockers off the snap. Former high school state champion wrestler who understands leverage and generally plays beneath opponents' pads. Hands not only powerful but efficient as a pass rusher. Utilizes good arm-over move on interior. Rarely stops working through the whistle. Utilized length and motor to rack up a monstrous 2015 season. Unselfish and willing to spring others in twist game. Peers into backfield and maintains focus on the ball. Shows some natural power at point of attack to stymie base blockers and clog his gap."," Lacks defined, athletic build in lower half. Slow-twitch player. Doesn't have much juice out of his stance and up the field. Pass-rush production helped along by strong motor and level of competition. Might not have NFL skill set for translatable pass-rush success. Shows marginal closing burst to the ball. Quick disengagement from NFL offensive linemen could be an issue. Struggled to impose will and disengage quickly from quality left tackle from West Georgia in 2015. Could be caught between positions.", PFA,," Hard-nosed, effort-based defensive end who stacked heavy sack production against a lower level of competition. Background as a wrestler gives him a greater understanding of leverage and allows him to punch above his weight at the point of attack. Lacks the desired twitch from a true defensive end and the mass of a full-time interior player, but his above-average length, effort and hand usage gives him a shot to become an NFL player at some point."
Joe Williams,RB," Plus athlete. Has get-away burst in small spaces. Flashes breakaway speed to take it to the house if he gets up to the safeties. Sudden second gear to turn the corner or accelerate through line of scrimmage. Carries weight in his lower half, allowing for unique contact balance. Able to recover from hits that bring most runners down. Runs feet through initial contact and blows through arm tackles. Makes defenders earn their tackles and is hard to bring down. Can create with wiggle and power. Has lateral shuffle of a basketball player to slink out of traffic jams and escape outside. Can string moves together on second and third levels. Lowers pads to finish runs with momentum."," ""Retired"" for a month before coming back after Utah running back corps was depleted due to injuries. Questions have arisen about his football character and commitment to the game. Ball security issues are a concern; lost six fumbles over 289 carries at Utah. Needs to press line of scrimmage longer before making his cuts. Will run into traffic that he might be able to avoid. Shows occurrences of hesitation if he doesn't have a clean point of entry between tackles. Runs a little too tall approaching line of scrimmage. Non-factor as third-down option. Rarely catches passes and not committed to blocking.", Rounds 6-7, Jerick McKinnon," Draft grade is affected by some of the character concerns that could preclude his NFL career from taking off. The more tape you watch, the more you become impressed with Williams' ability to keep runs alive that other running backs couldn't. His ability to create yardage for himself is a necessary piece of the puzzle for NFL runners, but his inability to contribute on third downs could hurt his draft stock. Williams has talent as a runner and could fit a roster spot if teams are okay with his background."
Gavin Andrews,OG," Has the size NFL teams dream of along the interior. Well-proportioned with long arms, a thick chest and burly legs. Has the pure mass to engulf linebackers when he squares them up. Power and arm length make stuffing a bull rush fairly easy. Has ability to stalemate and neutralize his opponent when he anchors up as base blocker against power across from him. His lateral wash-down blocks can widen out rushing lanes. Can swing between guard and center."," Feet are heavy and slow. Just a mauler. Legs appear to need oil. Stiffness in knees prevent fluid movement and keep him in the phone booth. Plodding climbs to second level. Unable to adjust to movement in space. Waist-bender in his pass sets and base blocks. Weight is regularly too far forward, causing him to consistently slides off his blocks. Struggles to slide inside the pocket and catch looping rushers underneath. Cut blocks are slow and telegraphed.", PFA,," Heavy-legged mammoth with outstanding size and length but a stiffness in his lower body that prevents him from functional movement needed for the position. While his anchor, power and ability to play center or guard could appeal to some teams, finding a long-term home on a roster could be a challenge."
Antonio Garcia,OT, Outstanding athleticism. Very good lateral quickness coming out of stance. Former high school hooper who still has basketball feet. Able to mirror pass rushers before and after engagement. Rarely beaten cleanly around edge by speed. Continues to slide feet and maintain engagement up and around pass arc. Works to keep his blocks centered in his power zone. Easily redirects back inside to chase an inside challenge. Has loose hips and quick feet providing recovery ability. Plays with his length. Fluid in space and can get to challenging angles. Keeps battling to anchor if he gets bumped early. Finds ways to get his man blocked.," Carries stringy frame with upper body that looks like a defensive end. Lack of lower body strength exacerbated by elevated pad level. Needs to bend hips to dip pad level below defender's. In pass protection, opens outside hip up early rather than staying square in initial stages. Hands take outside path to target and punch can be ill-timed, allowing rusher first strike into his frame. Defaults to lunging at target when he panics. Lacks anticipation against twists. Will have to add more bulk and strength. Grabs and holds to counter bull-rush. Narrow base carries no power as base blocker in run game. Footwork and angles inconsistent on reach blocks.", Round 2, Jared Veldheer," Consistently playing below 300 pounds, his lanky frame is the first thing that gets noticed. But his positive attributes show up on tape more than his weaknesses. Mass and functional strength are concerns and he still needs plenty of technical work, but a team could look to draft and stash him based on his starter's traits and ability."
Chad Wheeler,C," Solid athlete. Competitive with high football character. Comes off the snap with controlled, tight footwork in short areas. Works to stay connected to his blocks. Balanced on angle blocks with ability to keep his man centered while chopping feet. At best as a move blocker. Can make cross-face blocks and cut blocks. Shines with his ""work-up"" blocks. Always spies his second block while securing his first and climbs up to his target with easy, controlled pace. Can redirect body to adjust on second-level blocks. Able to pull and lead the charge. Can snatch and ride pass rushers when he lands the first punch."," Missed time in each of last three seasons, and also missed spring practices in 2013 with knee injury and part of senior season in high school with shoulder surgery. Core strength is below average. Comes out of stance with high pad level and leverage game suffers. Initial contact at point of attack lacks pop. Rarely rolls hips under his pads for desired drive-blocking power. Ducks head and loses sight of his man. Stack-and-shed defenders can discard him. Carries hands low and punch timing is off in pass pro. Needs to play with inside hands. Tries to manufacture anchor through his lean. While anticipating contact with rusher his feet deaden, robbing him of functional recovery skills.", Round 7-PFA, Ty Sambrailo," A move blocker with the ability to operate confidently in space while lacking the power to whip the man across from him. Lack of core strength and consistent footwork in pass protection could force him to make a move inside to guard for a zone team. Could become an eventual starter, but might be best-suited as a swing tackle on the NFL level."
Cam  Keizur,C," Decent athlete who was asked to work up to the second level in both running and screen game quite frequently. Plays with quiet, steady hands and desired hand placement inside the frame. Gives determined effort when matched against bigger and better interior defensive linemen. Has experience playing guard as well. Brings feet with him when redirecting A-gap blitzers."," Short arms come into play too often. When he loses battle to get first hands on his bigger opponents, he gets into trouble he can't get out of. Contact balance is very average and he ends up on ground too often. Unable to generate much movement despite solid contact. Down blocks against quality competition fail to consistently secure defender. Awareness against twists needs improvement.", UDFA,," From a technical standpoint, he does several things right, but he doesn't have the power necessary to make up for his 31-inch arms. Keizur does have the movement skills to warrant a look from zone-scheme teams, but he might have to find his way into a camp as an undrafted free agent."
Dieugot Joseph,OT," Well-proportioned, athletic frame. Extremely long arms with big hands. Uses length to bolster his recovery ability when beaten. Hands have some strength to latch into pass rushers. Uses inside hand as a stiff jab when he punches with it. Feet are bouncy in his redirect back inside. Athletic enough to change direction and catch stunts and blitzes with his feet. The earlier he sets and throws hands, the better off he is. Adequate lateral quickness for angle blocks. Shows ability to make centered contact on the move. Has zone-blocking athleticism.", Needs time to add functional mass and muscle to his body. Gets stuck in the mud when trying to drive stronger defenders off their spot as a base blocker. Has difficult time keeping hands punch ready during his kick-slide and is often second with his hands. A leaner who has issues keeping his weight back and on the inside of his post foot. Body control and anchor are below desired mark. Hand placement too far outside in general. Fails to get feet and hips into position on reach-block attempts. Doesn't run feet under his hands in run game., Round 6-7,," Intriguing physical traits and tools, but he will need extensive technique work in order to eliminate some of the bad habits that are holding him back. Teams will be attracted to his length, and one will take him on Day 3 (Rounds 4-7) and try and bring him along slowly as a left tackle lottery ticket they hope pays off down the line."
Caleb Peterson,OG, Consistently provides quality double-team work with the center. Snaps hips up under him as run blocker. Plays with adequate leverage at point of attack. Shows good athletic ability popping out of stance and racing around the corner on pull blocks. Aims and operates with inside hands.," Functional anchor is a problem. Unable to consistently anchor at shallow depths in pass pro and can be walked back deep into the pocket. Loses the arm-length battle, giving up his chest to long-arm defenders. Struggles to maintain balance and base through contact at an angle.", UDFA,," A fundamentally sound player who is lacking functional strength. While he usually gets off to a quick start in his reps, he struggles to maintain and finish his blocks on a consistent basis."
Trey Hendrickson,OLB," Good upper-body turn that presents a difficult target for tackles to punch. Rushes with good lean and has a strong club hand to soften the edge. Uses arm extension and acceleration to generate some speed-to-power push. Impressive, fluid footwork with spin move counter. Hands are effective at warding off cut blocks. Good lateral quickness to squeeze running lane. Rakes at the ball as tackler, forcing six fumbles over final two seasons at FAU. Special teams demon; blocked a punt, two field goals and an extra point in 2016."," Average height with lean legs and short arms for the edge. Not an ""other side of the line"" run defender. A tick slow to diagnose and respond off snap. Allows blockers to cross his face and beat him to the block. Got hooked and secured by smallish tight end Jonnu Smith from Florida International. Needs to do better job of thumping and setting a strong edge. Plays too tall in his tackle-end twist transitions, allowing blockers under his pads.", Round 3-4,," More of a second-effort sack man than a quick-win specialist, but he did show some edge rushing ability at the Shrine Game practices that didn't flash as often on tape. His lack of length on the edge will be a turnoff for some, but he flashes enough to warrant a third-day draft selection as a backup 4-3 defensive end who could continue to develop as a rusher with additional work."
Brooks Ellis,ILB," Instinctive with a technician approach. Scrapes with squared shoulders and quality pad level. Slides from gap to gap, mirroring ball carrier, and is careful not to overshoot his pursuit. Plays with an authoritative punch and good arm extension when attacking blockers. In constant movement on balls of his feet and rarely caught flat-footed. Maintains vision beyond the blockers in front of him. Reliable and aware. Productive tackler who also shows an ability to squeeze receivers from zone coverage. Has three years of coverage experience on special teams.", Slow-twitch athlete. Lacks suddenness of movement and instant burst to overcome mistakes. Margin for error is slight. Tape reveals a lack of functional speed to chase runners to the perimeter. Misses tackles that appear to be in his grasp due to lack of close-out burst. Will have issues maintaining coverage against NFL running backs in space., PFA,," There are so many things to like when you watch the tape. He's smart, instinctive, productive and technically sound. However, his lack of functional NFL speed will be very difficult to overcome. If Ellis tests well, he could work himself into Day 3 (Rounds 4-7) consideration. Back end of the roster might be the best he can hope for due to his lack of recovery ability and raw athleticism."
Justin Evans,S," Tremendous athlete who was heralded as a baseball pitcher, and receiver and defensive back in football coming out of high school. Has feet and hips for easy toggle between backpedal and angled shuffle as high safety. Ball skills of a slot receiver. Plays with excellent passion for the game. Can snare at the highest point thanks to well-timed leaps, great arm extension and supple hands. Big accelerator to close out crossing routes and disrupt the passing lane. Very good plant-and-go twitch. Looks to make plays taking aggressive routes to the ball. Logged four interceptions and seven pass breakups as a senior. Fast with ability to range over the top from high safety. Seeks out collisions and doesn't shrink from contact. Completely laid-out Alabama's Derrick Henry during hit in 2015 game. Wrap-up tackler who explodes into target and runs his feet through the finish."," Needs improved eye-balance. Has issues splitting focus between ball and man. From second level, hyper-focuses on receiver keys and is late finding running back headed his way. Aggressive nature could make him a play-action target on pro level. Instincts dwindle the further away from line of scrimmage he goes. Inconsistent seeing and breaking on throws from high safety. Needs to come to balance in tackle-ready position more quickly on third-level stops. His heart is bigger than his body. Needs more bulk to withstand fallout from his physical play. Gets stuck to blocking tight ends from slot and struggles to unglue.", Rounds 2-3, Karl Joseph," Soft-spoken but carries a walloping stick. Plays the game with an elevated sense of urgency and excitement. He is a little undersized, but has plus speed, is an extremely physical hitter and can play deep or near the line of scrimmage. Athleticism and ball skills might lead a team to test him out as a slot corner. Regardless of where he plays, he has the talent to become a plus NFL starter and a potential Day 2 (Rounds 2-3) draft selection."
Bret Treadway,C," One of the most athletic interior linemen in the 2017 draft. Uses fluid footwork and takes outstanding angles up to his second-level adversaries. Good body control and contact balance. Zone-blocking winner. Strong lateral quickness and accelerates feet into and through contact. When blocking on the move, able to keep his defender centered and engaged. Excellent radar in space, finding targets and adjusting his track according to their movements. Big hands for his size. Lands punch inside the frame and locks in. Tenacious worker bee who is hard to shake once hes under defenders' pads. Excels on combo blocks. Started all four years at Lamar."," Has the lower body of an NFL tight end. In desperate need of greater overall mass, but might not have the frame to keep his weight up. Has calves of a tight end. Lack of size could limit his scheme fits. Has to make sure pad level stays on point. Lacks power to redirect strong defenders who get to his edge. Ability to handle and NFL bull-rush is in question.", FA, J.C. Tretter," Has Day 2 (Rounds 2-3) talent and plays with a level of consistency and tenacity that offensive line coaches dream about. Unfortunately, a lack of NFL mass could be a non-starter for many NFL teams, and if there are also medical concerns to go with it, he could very well go undrafted. However, if his medicals are right and he is able to pack some mass on, he has an opportunity to be taken on the third day (Rounds 4-7) and become an eventual starting center."
Jordan Sterns,SS," Has adequate NFL size, but should be able to add more bulk if needed. Triggers fast against the run and had rare tackle production over a three-year run. Has ability to play robber spot and above average instincts give him a head start to challenge throws. Reads plant foot of quarterback on three-step drops and will jump slants. Tough and smart. A favorite of the coaching staff. Will go and get tackles on kick coverage unit."," Average athlete who is a little stiff in his hips. Transitions are bulky. Slow in his pedal and not a natural pattern-matcher in man coverage. Thirsty in coverage and bites too readily on play-action and ""sluggo"" routes. Lacks long speed to recover when beaten. Lacks the range and athleticism to play centerfield. Box safety type, but isn't a commanding, physical presence.", PFA,," Probably won't be a very strong tester from an athletic standpoint, but it will be hard to ignore his production and leadership. Strong pre-draft workouts could help his cause, but his initial opportunity to make a roster will probably come via special teams. Backup potential as a ceiling."
Avery Gennesy,OT," Has lateral agility and desire to get to difficult reach blocks in zone game. Rapid responder out of snap. Shoots out on top of defensive ends with quick sets and hustles to swing his hips into position to wall off three-techniques on gap plays. Able to torque his hips and widen defenders off the edge. Moves well in space with desired body control on all levels. Can pull effectively. Choppy, controlled kick slide. Able to gain enough ground against most edge speed. Feet and balance help mirror effectively and can redirect back inside. Latches onto defenders with strong hands. Has length and athletic ability for adequate recovery when beaten. Aware and alert. Senses twists coming and understands how to handle them."," High-cut with long waist and stiffness in his hips. Not a natural bender. Too tall into pass sets, allowing bull-rushers a viable attack point under his pads. Fears speed-to-power rushers and leans into engagements in order to supplement his anchor. Rarely asked to generate push at point of attack as base blocker and might lack leverage to do it on pro level. Hands prefer to gather and grab rather than punch. Average block finisher. Wide hands might be muscle-memory issue that is difficult to correct. At the top of the rush arc, will push and muscle rushers rather than continuing to slide feet to cut off the angle. Edges a little soft and could struggle to find redirect strength.", Round 5, Marshall Newhouse," Former junior college transfer who displayed the athleticism that allowed Texas A&M; to keep Germain Ifedi at right tackle in 2015. Foot quickness could make him a target of teams who ask more from their tackles in the run game, but his lack of bend could create consistent issues against bull-rushers. While teams could try him at guard, he will likely stay outside at tackle and compete as a swing tackle right away."
Deon Hollins,OLB, Very good slant quickness to disrupt blocking assignments. Comes up the field in a hurry as a pass rusher. Built low to the ground and is able to play under the tackle's punch if allowed to get to the corner. Can be tough to redirect as pass rusher. Good change of direction to chase scrambling quarterbacks. Had nine sacks in 2014., Too tiny to play at defensive end. Appears to be without a position. Inability to play off the ball was exposed in 2015 when he was used as an outside linebacker. Has seen dramatic reductions in his playing time. Grab-and-hold tackler. Gets pulverized when tackles center him up., UDFA,," Too small to play along the defensive line and missing the instincts and ability to play in space. Likely will go undrafted. Best hope is to make a statement as a special teams performer and try to parlay that into a ""rush specialist"" spot."
Joe Scelfo,C, Compact build with plus contact balance and functional strength at point of attack. Great football instincts and feel for his position. Can adjust assignment and timing based on what is happening in front of him. Controlled second-level climber with good strike rate on his targets. Agile enough to cut on second level. Stays glued with his fellow double-team block and climbs to second block with good timing. Upward strikes create leverage points to secure his down blocks. Strong hand grip to snatch his opponent's frame. Can sustain blocks in a phone booth., Lack of length is a concern. Defenders can get into his frame early in the rep. Has stiffness in his knees and is forced to play too straight-legged. Short stepper who is doomed against quick tackles on lateral blocks. Gains very little early ground on the move and doesn't have the athleticism to secure them when he gets ahead in the rep early. Needs help to drive nose tackles off their spots. Long limbs and active pass rushers will be a problem on the next level. Marginal recovery ability due to stiffness and lack of length., PFA,," He's not very tall, his arms are short, and he plays with some stiffness in his legs, but his tape is consistent from game to game and he has enough play strength to compete for a roster spot at some point. He's a center only, which hurts his chances, but guys like him have made it in the league in years past."
Anthony McMeans,C," Good natural upper body strength. Appears to have good strength in his hands. When he's able to latch onto opponent's frame, he can match strength with strength. Flashed some power in his down blocks against Ole Miss in 2015. Shows ability to bend and cut his man."," Squatty frame carrying some excess baggage in his core. Hand placement can be very poor at times. Will get out-tussled in heads-up matchups and is unable to control the reps with balance and footwork. Doesn't gain ground quickly enough when asked to move laterally, causing inconsistencies with play-side cutoff blocks. Needs to take better angles on second-level blocks.", UDFA,," Went to New Mexico State from a junior college and immediately fit into the Lobos' plans, becoming a two-year starter. Squatty frame puts him at a disadvantage when matched against bigger, longer opposition, and he doesn't have the athletic ability to counter his physical limitations. Game is based on power more than movement. A one-position player who won't offer traits that most teams look for in a draftable center."
Wayne Gallman,RB, Has quality burst through line of scrimmage to rip through arm tackles and attack the second level. Runs with plus effort every time he touches the ball. Keeps feet grinding through second level contact. Uses shoulders as legitimate weapons of force against would-be tacklers. Creates additional yards through functional wiggle. Good outside-in cuts to defeat contain. Angular runner with build-up speed to win a race around the edge. Hard charging. Trusted option on fourth and short situations. Decisive in the red zone and brings some attitude with him. Finished with 28 rushing touchdowns over last two seasons. Strong second effort near the goal line when his initial charge is stopped. Will offer some help as pass catcher.," Leggy, long-strider. Unable to make sharp, sudden cuts in tight quarters. Extended gear down could cause NFL holes to close on him. Vision becomes restricted when running between tackles. Gives away three sure yards searching along riskier lanes. Lacks finesse in his game. Has bull in china shop running style between tackles. Upright in approach to line of scrimmage. Will allow tacklers under his pads too often. Gets impatient and won't always keep the track behind lead blocker. Below average balance. Can be upended by shoe-string attempts. Not ready for NFL pass protection duties yet.", Round 4-5, Khiry Robinson," Comes with NFL-ready body and a competitive running style. Gallman has limited instincts as an interior runner and needs lanes rather than creases, but he's physical enough to bang out tough yardage. Gallman runs with pace and shows traits of being a one-cut runner who is better off with focused, pre-set tracks rather than searching for his own. He could be an early contributor in a committee with a future as an eventual starter."
Ben Braden,OG, Part of a physical unit. Shows good initial hand placement and typically lands where he aims in his initial punch. Looks to jolt opponent with his hands. Has good upper body strength and looks to maul. Will gallop into secure block and blast defensive tackles in the ribs. Looks to widen base and anchor up against power. Tough guy who's willing to get his block by any means necessary. Shallow sets in his pass protection.," Stiff as a board in his pass sets. Punch is a tick slow. Plays with very little knee bend and struggles to drop his pad level below his opponents. As play progresses, allows his hands to slide up the frame of defenders. Doesn't generate push through lower body. Has to lean due to lack of flexibility, which causes balance issues. Plodder in space. Too slow for the long pull blocks. Falls off of blocks rather than sustaining.", Round 7-PFA,," Gritty guard with plenty of tough guy in him, but lacking necessary flexibility and athleticism to operate at a consistent level against more talented competition. Could get a late-round nibble, but will always have his hands full if matched up against an athletic defender across from him."
Kenneth Olugbode,OLB, Angular frame and looks the part. Impressive production with 93 tackles coming solo. Looks to race ahead of the big bodies who climb to second level. Prefers to look running backs up in the hole rather than catch them at angles. Able to sink hips and dip shoulder under blocker's power zone to maintain positioning in the gap. Crowds receivers from zone coverage and will attack catch point., Tape shows a lack of natural speed and quickness. Instincts below average. Slow to diagnose and respond. At times will turn shoulders to run in pursuit rather than using controlled shuffles to mirror and maintain his run fits. Runs himself into traffic with poor angles to the ball. A step slow and a little too tight in hips for extended man coverage. Lacks functional strength to counter power he will see on next level., PFA,," Tackle numbers will catch the eye, but the tape isn't as kind. Has some good moments, but he lacks desired play strength, instincts and play speed for the position. If he is to make it in the NFL, he will have to play with a much more consistent motor to overcome some of his physical shortcomings."
Teez Tabor,CB," Prototypical size and athleticism. Plays with bouncy feet in coverage. Good initial patience and foot quickness to mirror receiver's release from press. Has the quick twitch to accelerate and pattern match receivers throughout their routes. Has recovery speed to bird-dog crossers. From zone, can split high/low routes and is quick enough to challenge the catch on either. Has agility and change of direction to come off of one route and pick up the next. Shines when the ball is in the air. Pro-ready closing burst. Has excellent hand-eye coordination. Hands and timing help turn opportunities into interceptions. Posted 28 passes defensed over the last two years. Finished career with nine interceptions at Florida. Willing to unload into receiver's ribs in order jar a ball free."," Whispers in scouting circles that Tabor fears deep speed. Often played excessively deep off-coverage. Shows balance issues in space. Occasionally loses footing in coverage during his transition. Shows willingness to sit on routes and grab receivers trying to go vertical rather than flipping hips to chase. Can be undisciplined from zone losing track of his responsibilities. Appears to be hit or miss with instinctive playmaking. Doesn't play to his listed size. Finesse cornerback. Avoids mixing it up with physical receivers away from the ball. Too many weak tackle attempts. Charted with 13 missed tackles in 2015.
Scouts consider him to be a high-maintenance prospect. Has been suspended due to drug tests and a run-in with a teammate in practice.", Rounds 2-3, Darius Slay," Tabor has terrific size and quickness, but his pedestrian 40 times at both the combine and his pro day workout are hard to ignore. While he has some lapses in judgement and awareness in coverage, his nine career interceptions didn't happen by accident. Tabor can pattern match around the field, but he may need safety help over the top if he's playing on the outside. If he's going to be a zone corner, he'll have to do a better job of tackling. Tabor looks like a second day pick."
Josh Tupou,NT," Wide as a house. Squatty frame with big, strong legs. Can drop a heavy anchor and man his area of the turf. Centers struggle to get any kind of movement against him without help. Space-eater who can post and eat up the gaps. Good upper body strength to fend off shoulder or hip-torque moves to tilt him off balance.", Might be playing a little too heavy. Stiff and slow. Has extremely limited area of effectiveness. Can be slow to unhinge from his block and pursue the play. Lacks functional lateral movement to stay on the play-side of the run. Slow out of stance and gets hooked by guards. No pass-rush value. Lacks ability to impact a game outside of his small area., Rounds 5-6,," Does one thing and one thing only -- eat up space. Doesn't have enough reactive quickness or even functional movement to find himself in many plays that aren't right at him, but his size and anchor gives him a shot with a team who values pure girth for early downs."
Marcus Cox,RB, Won't dance around and will finish when the run has come to its conclusion. Won't just give into a tackle attempt. Keeps legs moving through contact. Quality head fakes in the open field to shake tacklers and add to his yardage. Good feel for natural space inside the running lane. Can keep his rush track over the hip of a blocker to keep him away from defenders. Will get in the way as a pass blocker.," Lacks an NFL burst. Not much juice in his feet and his cuts lack suddenness. Strides approaching line of scrimmage appear to be same length and pace. Has to head downhill with more urgency. As interior runner, appears to anticipate contact too early, causing him to shell up. Creativity as a runner is hit or miss from run to run. Unlikely option as third-down back.", UDFA,," Plays with decent vision and a good feel for running lanes, but lacks the strength and acceleration to get to and through the creases on the next level. Could find himself in a camp, but will have an uphill battle."
Sidney Jones,CB, Competes all over the field. Doesn't play pitty-pat with his jam from press. Throws stiff lead right into the shoulder of receivers like a boxer. Maximizes contact with receivers within first five yards. Eyes are top notch. Balances between quarterback's eyes and his man from all off coverages. Ready to close on throws anywhere near his area. Route magnet. Pattern anticipation allows him to map receivers path and undercut route. Prioritizes ball over man and attacks catch point with slaps and rips. Has nine career interceptions and got a hand on 21.3 percent of balls thrown his way over last two seasons. Early ball tracker with length and leaping to attack the high point. Mirrors receiver acceleration out of their breaks. Twitchy feet for click-and-close transitions and instant change of direction from shuffle technique. Solid recovery quickness., Tore his Achilles tendon at his pro day which will require an extensive rehab process. Carries slender frame. Needs to add upper body strength in preparation for NFL size.

Gets impatient from press. Loses positioning by reaching and lunging to get hands on receiver rather than letting the release come to him. Can still improve his transition footwork. Fights his hips a little when flipping to change direction in open field. Physical receivers can wall him out of tackle action in run support., Round 2-3, Marcus Peters," Jones is a ""casino cornerback"" who has the ball skills and instincts to tilt the odds in his favor when quarterbacks look his way. His toughness and desire to make plays on the ball are remarkably similar to his friend and off-season workout buddy, Marcus Peters. Jones has lockdown corner talent but unfortunately, teams will have to wrestle with his draft positioning as there is no guarantee that Jones can come back with the same quickness and speed as before."
Ryan Ramczyk,OT," Fires out of stance with pads tucked under bent knees. Accelerates into target. Punch and extend drive blocker with hip flip to lock in leverage. Pushes with flat back and duck-footed follow through to sustain and walk defender off his mark. Technician who has been taught the fundamentals. Good tape in both power and zone plays.

In constant state of mirroring rusher and rarely breaks down early to lunge or lean around the edge. Excellent awareness against twists and blitzes.", Has linear frame with narrow shoulders and short arms for the position. Lack of a broad frame makes protecting his edge more challenging. Edge players with length land jabs to his frame to create separation. Will play too upright and straight-legged at times. Can't afford to be late out of stance as his first two kick slides don't gain much ground. Could have issues on redirect blocks against inside shots. Having arthroscopic surgery on torn labrum in hip and is expected to miss combine as well as pro day workouts due to recovery., Round 1, Joe Staley, Extremely confident tackle with the athleticism to stay on the left side and the technique to make an early impact as a starter. Ramczyk has the core strength and body control that should keep him connected to blocks in both the run and pass and he's proven to be scheme versatile with his playing style. Ramczyk is an early starter with the potential to become a good starting left tackle provided his medicals hold up.
Ryan Switzer,WR," High-volume target for UNC QB Mitch Trubisky. Reliable pass catcher with low career drop rate. Sudden feet to shake press defenders out of his release. Plays at his top speed and doesn't coast. Accelerates and separates on speed outs. Utilizes repeatable footwork in routes. Patterns are crisp. Comes out of breaks at sharp angles and snaps head around immediately to find the ball. Owns comeback routes by driving hard back to the throw. Shows traits of effective option-route specialist in short-yardage and red area. Able to defeat inside leverage technique and find his way back underneath. Had five punt-return touchdowns his freshman season and has seven for his career, with 19 career returns of more than 15 yards.", Short target with very limited catch radius. Struggles to haul throws behind him. Needs accurate quarterbacking to do his job. Doesn't have get-away speed and will have NFL cornerbacks sitting on all of his underneath work. Benefits from misdirection within UNC offense. Not a hands-catcher. Routes feature similar speed throughout and could benefit from change of speeds. Quick but not overly athletic. Struggled to find yards for himself in catch-and-run hitch tosses and wide receiver screens., Round 6, David Anderson," Wes Welker and Julian Edelman have become go-to comparisons for undersized slot receivers who utilize option routes to torment defenders underneath, but Switzer isn't quite on that level. However, he's able to create separation underneath and shows quality release quickness. Switzer is a slot-only target with punt return skills, but he has to find the right scheme fit to become a factor in the NFL."
Quincy Wilson,CB, Prototypical size for cornerback or safety spot. Big and physical. Very competitive. Willing to accept challenge of taking on a team's top wideout. Uses play strength to overcome some athletic and speed deficiencies. Can maul receivers off line of scrimmage and eliminate them from a route if they don't get clean release against his press.

Good feel for when to step downhill as tackler. Plays off perimeter blocks quickly. Willing to stick his nose in as a tackler. Willing to be the hammer and not just the nail when it comes to challenging running backs.," Hips and feet can be exceedingly sticky in his transitions. Will fight his feet a little in his backpedal and shuffle. Footwork average in space. When feet fail him, he opts to use his hands. Could see spike in illegal contact and holding penalties if asked to play corner early in career. Reliant upon strength and grit in man coverage over speed and athleticism. Plays too tall which hinders click-and-close burst. Allows too much separation against complex routes. Below average reactive athleticism for the position and will struggle to carry long speed.", Round 2, Tre' Boston," Wilson rose to prominence this year after finishing with three interceptions and allowing fewer than 40 percent of the passes his way to be completed. His size and physicality combined with issues in staying glued to quick receivers could lead him to the safety spot where his instincts, ball skills and willingness to tackle will all serve him well."
Stevie Tu'ikolovatu,NT," Possesses a jarring initial punch. Built low to the ground with ability to strike at upward angles. Gets his initial hand placement right and is able to win control at the point of attack. Not content to just eat space and lay on his block. Finds runners and looks to mirror to make plays. Looks to shuck quickly. Agile big man with ability to move down the line. Uses power to get late separation from blockers and make tackles against runners using his lane. Has experience eating double teams to keep his linebackers clean. Strong, wide base keeps him on his feet. Drain-clogger near the goal line."," Portly frame with plenty of heft around the middle. Despite natural leverage, still allows centers under his pads when fatigued. Needs to stop allowing centers to hang around on blocks rather than overwhelming them. Should learn how to clean his frame and free himself by swatting blockers' hands away. Longer centers stifle his strengths. Can press pocket a little bit as rusher but not enough to matter in the pros. Likely limited to early down snaps only.", Rounds 4-5, Brandon Williams," Left Utah to earn more playing time at USC and it seemed to pay dividends. With a jarring punch that sets him up for success, he is able to get rid of blockers for quick wins and is a productive tackler once he's free."

Plays with inconsistent base width and balance. Will allow secure blocks to slip out of the side door due to poor footwork. Leans into run blocks rather than running feet under him. Has to keep his feet alive and moving after initial contact. Hand approach and placement is spotty. Loses base on lateral work due to tall pad level and uneven weight dispersal., Rounds 4-5, LaAdrian Waddle," Raw tackle lacking in technique but long on physical traits. Has been able to dominate against lower level of competition and his step up in competition during pre-draft workouts will either throw a wet blanket over his draft grade or send his stock soaring. Despite a lack of technique, his traits will have teams willing to draft and wait for him as a project. He will be a work in progress and might be forced to move to the right side."
Nazair Jones,DT, Has good size with long arms and thick lower half. Play strength is above average. Likes to iniate the contact at point of attack. Initial punch has some shock behind it and he has the power to press defenders off of his chest and keep them at the end of his length. Hand placement generally sound. Can beat one-on-one blocks. Has ability to set the edge and man both gaps. Good twitch in his shed to disengage and make the tackle. Above average tackle production for interior. Rarely beaten soundly by a base block.

Lacks feel for flow of the play causing him to play behind the blocks rather than racing in front of them. Lacks feet to recover past a reach block. Needs to operate with more width in his base for balance consistency. Below average change of direction. Plows head-first into pass protection. Doesn't have much of a rush plan and is still looking for a competent counter move. Plays with some stiffness in lower half which affects pad level.", Rounds 4-5, Joel Heath, Phone booth defender who has good length and the power to fight for control at the point of attack. Jones' strength is his ability to play the run and he could be a physical fit for 3-4 teams looking to add a run defender to their linemen corps. His inability to get the quarterback will cap his draft slotting but he does have pro potential.
Myles Garrett,DE," Chiseled physique with functional strength, and not just beach muscles. Bigger than people think. Uber-athlete with spring-loaded hips and elite explosiveness. Powerful legs allow him to fight through redirect blocks and corner the edge at a sharp angle. Dominant pass-rush ability and production in college. Remarkable burst off the snap. His first three steps can throw an offense into disarray. When he times the snap, tackles have almost no chance of catching him at the edge. Wicked, whirling, dervish inside spin move that's reminiscent of Dwight Freeney's. Charges, coils, and springs up into tackles to help facilitate a quality bull rush. Game-wrecking potential. Has game experience against the likes of La'el Collins, Shon Coleman, Cam Robinson and Laremy Tunsil. Can play with a hand in the ground or standing. Able to spin in either direction out of block engagement. Lightning-fast inside charge extremely disruptive against the run. Gobbles up grass with long strides in open-field pursuit. Plus acceleration to the runner. Quick twitch creates ability to bound suddenly into running backs looking to charge past line of scrimmage. Outstanding rate as a tackle finisher with running backs and quarterbacks rarely escaping his clutches. Looks to maintain run fits rather than play hero ball. Has ability to play on both sides of the line of scrimmage."," Relies heavily on tremendous athleticism and explosion. Still learning how to string moves together and work with a pass-rush plan. At times, will take too long to activate counter moves when initial attack has stalled. Effort level appears closely tied to fatigue level at times. As pass rusher, uses hands reactively too often rather than proactively. Gets too cozy with blockers and will ride block for too long. Needs more urgency in disengagement. Would benefit with violent stick-and-move punch quickness into blockers. Has to work overtime to set a strong edge. Gets uprooted and widened out by quality run-blocking tackles. Never played in more than 70 percent of the defensive snaps in any of his three seasons at Texas A&M.; Scouts are convinced he took plays off to protect his health this season.", Top 3 pick, Julius Peppers," Elite edge rusher who possesses rare explosiveness and the fluid-movement skills and agility of an NBA shooting guard. Good size, but he's never likely going to be a hold-your-ground run defender, and might be best suited as an outside linebacker. However, his ability to explode into the backfield through a gap or around the edge gives him disruptive potential on every snap. Garrett still needs to fine-tune his pass-rush strategy and could stand to give more consistent effort from the start of the snap until the whistle. But his pass-rush production and athletic traits point toward an all-pro career."
Mike Williams,WR," Prototypical height, weight, speed prospect. Fills out the uniform as well as any receiver in college football. Sells vertical push to create an early hip turn from backpedaling cornerbacks. Uses hands to create late separation on vertical throws.

Able to track it inside, outside or over his shoulder. Hands catcher who plucks it away from his body. Has body control to dig out the low balls and contort to grab throws Deshaun Watson leaves behind him. Concentration ramps up when routes take him between the hashes. Works middle of the field with no reservations about what is lingering. Has been asked to work all three levels of the field at Clemson. Can make cornerbacks miss after the catch and extend his play. Needs more commitment as a run blocker but has frame and strength to make a difference as a blocker."," Natural pass catcher who will occasionally run into focus drops. Drops issue found him over second half of the season. Route work lacks focus and energy. Creates very little indecision from cornerbacks with his head fakes and jab steps. Ability to win with physical traits could dry up on next level. Could use better understanding of route leverage to open wider passing lanes for quarterbacks. Plant-and-go at the stem lacks crispness as does acceleration from his cuts. Average release quickness. Gets hung up by press corners with a good lead jab. Needs to play to his size. Gets muscled against sideline too often. Fumbled twice this season. Neck injury forced him to miss entire 2015 season so until he clears combine medicals, teams may have a red flag on him.", Round 1, Plaxico Burress," Williams looks the part of a WR1 and has shown an ability to work all three levels of the field after coming back from his 2015 neck injury. Williams is tough enough to be a high-volume target while working the middle of the field and his size and ball skills make him a formidable foe in the end zone. He'll have to be coached up with his routes and releases, but he has the talent to become a big safety blanket for a young quarterback."
Duke Riley,LB," Got better as senior season progressed. Instincts and angles improved with more game experience. Had one of his better games against Alabama. Scouts impressed with improved play and consistency. Shows willingness to dart downhill and into the gaps to try and make a play in the backfield. Squares ball carrier in center of his strike zone and fires from hips into the tackle with good wrap up. Shows decent acceleration in his pursuit after diagnosing. Able to open hips and run with long, loose strides in open field. Has clear eyes and processes mesh-point quickly against zone-read and play-action. Gives early response to crossing routes in his area.", Undersized and could have limited position flexibility. Questionable play strength to take on blockers and constrict his gap. Only one season as a starter. Gets in trouble when he sits and waits in the hole. Has to trigger downhill early to overcome limited size and athleticism. Gets caught in the second-level trash in his pursuit. Needs to take better paths to the ball. Not a quick-twitch linebacker. Has build-up speed but lacks short-area quickness to finish from challenging tackle angles. Foot quickness isn't good enough to match up against running backs coming out of backfield., Round 3-4,," One-year wonder who produced at a consistent level despite his average athleticism and lack of starting experience. While he's mindful of his responsibilities, he's not overly physical and his limitations could tie him to roles as either a WILB in a 3-4 or WILL in a 4-3. Could improve stock in pre-draft workouts, but would be surprising to see him taken inside of the first three rounds."
Deyshawn Bond,C," Powerful upper body. Initial contact contains pop. Creates strong leverage points as base blocker. Explodes into down blocks and snaps hips under his hands to seal the deal. Capable in zone and in combo blocks, taking solid angles to second-level targets. Good snap to set quickness in pass protection. Able to handle a strong bull rush. Athletic with good foot quickness in his pass slide from gap edge to the other. Reactive quickness enables his recoveries. Good torque in his punch. Uses plus body control to mirror and engage pass rushers. Uses quick hands to catch and control twisters. Solid games against Houston's Ed Oliver and Purdue's Jake Replogle.", Undersized with short arms. Doesn't generate much drive off the snap. Leg drive gears down after contact. Can do better job of working feet into position after initial contact on both first and second levels. Slightly below average sustaining blocks. Can be beaten to the punch by length. Needs improved arm extension in his pass protection to keep rushers out of his frame. Will short his first block if he thinks a blitz is coming behind it. Needs to do better job of diagnosing blitz packages coming off the edge., Round 7-PFA, Patrick Lewis," Four-year starter with a combination of core strength and foot quickness that lends itself to success on the interior. Smaller than desired with below average length and that could hurt his draft stock, but he's a plus in pass protection and decent in run blocking and could become an eventual starter with time."
Matt Milano,LB," Well-defined with muscular arms and tapered waist. Wonderfully aggressive. Heat-seeking missile who looks for contact. Form tackler looking to strike, lift, and bury. Former safety with disciplined vision and above-average instincts. Can get home as blitzer. Reacts quickly to play-action screen passes and reverses. Good straight-line speed and revved motor for extended tackle range. Has some coverage ability in space. Durable two-year starter playing more than 94 percent of his team's defensive snaps. Accelerates through contact. Speed and toughness creates potential opportunities at multiple linebacker spots. Special teams demon with three blocked punts and 24 coverage tackles.", Needs to add a little more size to his frame. Can be outmuscled by size. Hand usage is inconsistent. Needs to improve in art of discarding blockers. Just average at punching and shedding to keep himself clean in take-on situations. Bad habit of ducking head into crunching tackles rather than seeing what he hits. Tightly wound with average change-of-direction talent. Can improve his path to perimeter to avoid traffic around him., Round 6-7, John Timu," Undersized for the linebacker spot, but extremely tough and aggressive. A little tight-hipped and might struggle to finish tackles that aren't right in front of him, but he brings as much pound-for-pound force behind his tackles as anyone in the draft. Productive player with good instincts and a nose for the ball. He has value as a 4-3 OLB and a 3-4 WILB, and should become a top contributor in coverage on special teams."
Malik McDowell,DT," Slippery and long. Combination of arm length and flexible torso allow him to slither into gaps and create disruptions for blockers. Freaky combination of size and athleticism. Can overwhelm blockers with pure strength and explosiveness when his feet are right. Strong enough in lower half to play through contact and cause stress in the pocket. Has tremendous amount of untapped potential waiting to be unlocked. Quick, strong hands in pass rush. Able to attack the edge with club-and-swim pet move. Can crank up a pocket-caving bull rush. Can redirect his weight and maintain pursuit of scrambling mobile quarterbacks. Long frame and play speed can close out perimeter runs and foil them before corner is turned. Elite playmaking radius. Explosive lateral movement and quickness. Can bound from one gap to the next in Sparty's slanting defensive front. Will be extremely difficult to cross face as he learns the position. Has experience up and down the defensive line."," Footwork and technique are a mess. Plays with inconsistent base width and overall balance. Struggles to keep feet clean and ends up on the ground. Lines up in narrow, three-point stance from interior and struggles to fight back against down blocks and double teams. Can be washed out of his gap too often. High center of gravity made interior work a challenge at times. Can bend, but lets high pad level get the best of him. Doesn't consistently utilize his length with first hands. Has to become better at controlling the point of attack with his natural attributes. Needs to punch and control rather than leaning on blockers. Production doesn't match up with the traits and the talent. Scouts concerned about work ethic and leadership.", Round 1, Ezekiel Ansah," Has similar physical traits and abilities of Arik Armstead and DeForest Buckner, but may not share their football character. McDowell lacked production along the interior and could benefit from a move to a defensive end spot in a 4-3 or 3-4 front. McDowell is raw, but when he flashes, it can be blinding. McDowell is an explosive, ascending prospect with All-Pro potential if he grows into his body and takes the necessary coaching."
"Paul Magloire, Jr.",LB," Instinctive around the box. Does a good job of reading and reacting with consistency. Has a good feel for the developing run lanes, and is able to read running back's intentions, mirroring them to their paths. Has experience at safety, inside linebacker and outside linebacker. Motor is always running. Approaches ball carriers in tackle-ready position. Drops into space and immediately has head on a swivel looking for coverage responsibilities.", Stiff through hips. Lower body is resistant to sudden change of direction. Poor reactive quickness limits his tackle range. Might be too tight to handle coverage in space. Inconsistent at playing off blocks. Needs to keep adding bulk and muscle to handle the rigors of the position. Gets eaten alive by size when he doesn't keep himself clean. Lacks the burst and recovery talent to take downhill chances into the gaps. Gets bullied off the edge as an outside linebacker and lacks NFL rush talent., PFA,," Plays hard and has the instincts needed for the position, but his lack of athleticism, size and play speed are likely too much to overcome on the next level."
Marquel Lee,LB, Good build with long arms. Shows some instincts in run game and reacts quickly to flow of the play. Races ahead of running back when he has play-side contain and spills it back inside. Team leader. Disciplined approach when plays flow to outside. Leads with his hands and has some pop in his punch. Tape was consistent and solid against Florida State. Scrapes downhill to secure backside when he recognizes his run fit. Adequate depth in his coverage drops.," Has a tendency to run himself into traffic. Bites on misdirection and inside zone plays. Drifts too close to line of scrimmage and becomes easy pickings for climbing linemen sealing off a cutback lane. Lacks athletic ability to spin out of trouble or climb over top of blocks. Lateral scrapes lose ground due to lack of quickness. At times, rides blocks rather than shucking and looking for work. Slow in change-of-direction transitions. Play speed is below average as are his man-cover skills.", Round 6-7,," Could play middle linebacker, but might lack the athletic traits to function in coverage or on the chase as an outside linebacker in a 4-3. Has good size and could benefit from NFL coaching, but the further he gets away from the line of scrimmage, the tougher the position becomes for him. Backup potential if he can prove himself on special teams."
Leonard Fournette,RB," Full-on, grown man with outstanding definition throughout his body. Built like a linebacker with speed like a receiver. Long, powerful strides get speedy turnover. Click and go runner who hits his second gear faster than most big backs you'll ever see. Able to accelerate and scream around the corner for chunk runs against linebackers lacking speed or urgency to the edge. Powerful hips and thighs shake defenders right off. Tacklers better bring full force and technique. Always the hammer and never the nail. Violent finisher looking to intimidate run-support safeties with crushing blows behind lower pads. Runs feet through any and all contact. Has balance and power to plow through tackle attempts on an angle. Punishing stiff arms go viral. Has experience running from two-back, single-back and off-set looks. Hands are adequate in passing game. Can create for himself with power and speed. Wins in short-yardage and goal-line situations."," Doesn't make many defenders miss with open field shake. Aggressive, take-on style could lead to shortened career. Struggles to elude sudden traffic at line of scrimmage. Lacks looseness of hips to jump-cut from gap to gap. Struggled with a bad ankle for most of the season. Plays through a straw. Excitable runner in need of more patience. Too quick to hit the accelerator and slam into defenders when there are still cuts and yards left in the play. Runs to obvious daylight but needs to learn to anticipate and finesse the crease in traffic. Doesn't see cutback lanes developing as outside zone runner and prefers to keep runs play-side. Throws half-hearted, grazing shoulder as chip blocker. Pass protection and routes need extensive work.", Round 1, Bo Jackson," High-end talent with rare blend of size, speed and power. Comparisons to Adrian Peterson feel lofty, but from a physical standpoint, he's there. Fournette doesn't have the wiggle to make defenders miss and his vision can be iffy. However, if your run fits and tackling aren't sound, he can take it the distance in an instant. May have durability concerns due to physical running style, but has All-Pro potential."
Dare Ogunbowale,RB," Runs with proper pad level. Decent hips to cut and swerve away from tacklers or shake them off. Runs hard through contact and can keep runs alive. Good feel for stretch plays and can shift paths without gearing down. Has good vision to make wise choices. Served as Wisconsin's third-down back. Soft hands and helped out of the backfield on screens, swings and ""V"" routes. Can separate from linebackers out of breaks. Swivels head and scans for work in pass protection. Gives a solid poke to pass rushers with chip blocks. Willing to square up a blitzer.", Runs with low knees. Run speed rarely varies. Lacks a big burst downhill and struggles to squeeze through tight creases. Will stutter step toward line of scrimmage unless he sees a clear rushing path. Benefitted from monster running lanes created by Wisconsin's offensive line. Try-hard back but not a dynamic runner; what you see is what you get. Doesn't have enough juice to accelerate to lateral escapes if he has to slow it down. Lacks desired speed for chunk runs. Not much of a catch radius. Has issues securing the low throws., Round 7-PFA,, A third-down back with the effort and consistency to compete for a roster spot on the next level. While his carry count is relatively low he's a serviceable option as a runner and has the pass-catching talent to compete for snaps on a team devoid of a prototypical third-down back.
KD Cannon,WR," Extremely athletic. Able to leap over low tackle attempts and twist upper body in mid-air to adjust to the throw. Smooth, long strider who can eat up cushions and go get it on vertical routes. Difficult to overthrow him. Looks to stack cornerbacks on his hip when he has desired positioning on post routes. Plus ball tracking. Adjusts his path to the flight of the ball and can track it over his shoulder. Typically a body catcher, but flashes ability to snatch throws well outside of his frame."," Slim frame lacks route strength. Pad level way too high into breaks for comeback routes causing him to skid to a stop. Shows some balance issues in his routes. Missing sharp stop-and-open ability to create space underneath. Body catcher who struggled with contested catches. Finished 2016 with nine drops. Waits on throws rather than snatching at the high point. Baylor offense prevented defenses from physically challenging his release. Ran a route stick with good stops, gos and stop-and-gos.", Rounds 4-5, Paul Richardson," Cannon is slightly build and a novice route-runner but has outstanding vertical speed to climb over the top of cornerbacks and force safety help his way. Cannon may not have the short area shiftiness for a move inside, so he will likely become a niche prospect who fits with teams looking for a field stretcher with some homerun potential."
Joe Mixon,RB, Outstanding burst to go from first level to third level. Goes from glide to burst quickly and can hit chunk plays between tackles and around corners. Can go from elusive to banger when he needs to. Will drop the pads and drive through tacklers in short yardage spots. Flashy feet for his size. Can jump-cut around defenders in tight quarters. Smooth hips help him swivel around the second and third levels. Able to show and go leaving linebackers diving as he escapes out of the side door. Strong stiff-arm helps would-be tacklers catch grass stains. Can turn the corner and create a straightaway to the end zone. Was Big 12 leader in percentage of explosive carries (15-plus yards) at 11.9 percent. True three-down back. Devastating pass catching option. Excellent route runner creating immediate separation. Soft hands to make the easy catch and the one-hander. Will step in and square up his blocking responsibilities in pass game., Some in scouting community concerned with character beyond his domestic violence incident. Inconsistent as inside runner. Can be too patient at times. Looks for wide-open points of entry before he hits the gas. Can be nonchalant approaching line of scrimmage. Dances downhill allowing running lanes to become creases. Feet lag behind when headed into congestion and will get loose with his rush track inviting tacklers a chance to get a hand on him. Lacks creativity in initial stages of his run at times. Vision is just average. Fails to see backside cuts developing on stretch plays. Hops into his downhill cuts rather than a crisp plant-and-go., Round 2-3, Le'Veon Bell," I've decided to give Joe Mixon a draft grade based on his talent and expected output if given a chance as an NFL running back. His draft slot will likely be impacted by his domestic violence issue. Mixon has the talent to be an every-down, all-day running back with the potential to take over a game on the ground or through the air. Life against weaker Big 12 defenses has created a more relaxed rushing approach for Mixon who will have to play at a faster pace as an NFL back. Mixon's vision is just average and he could struggle to create for himself in front of a subpar offensive line; however, he can play in any rushing scheme and can be moved all over the field as a matchup option."
Jeremy McNichols,RB," Able to elude sudden traffic in backfield. Not much dancing. Can shift rush tracks without tapping brakes. Fluid, flexible hips allow for multiple jump cuts and direction changes up to second level. Great vision and quick to process field in front of him.

Doesn't mind challenging tacklers. Stays low and finds crevices. Plus lateral agility and acceleration. Adequate speed to perimeter. Runs with body control and adjusts balance points to careen off tackle attempts. Legit pass catching option with five catches of 25-plus yards this year. Can be split out and work down the field. Two seasons of monster production on ground and through air.", May not have lower body power to be NFL tackle-breaker. Can be felled by first level arm tackles and averaged just 2.1 yards after initial contact this season. One-speed runner without the big burst to rocket through line of scrimmage and onto the safeties. Quicker than fast. Elusiveness will wane as run moves up to second and third levels. Will get caught between finishing and eluding at times. Needs to do better job of protecting ball at impact. Fumbled eight times over last two seasons. Can be spotty in his protection. Looks to chop rushers down low and will whiff at times., Round 3-4, Devontae Booker," Average sized running back who has boasted eye-popping production over last two seasons. McNichols runs with vision and tempo and has experience in a variety of formations, personnel groupings and schemes. McNichols needs work in pass protection and will likely create yardage with wiggle more than power, but he has the ability to contribute on all three downs and could find early work in a committee before challenging for starter's reps."
James Conner,RB," Team captain known for incredible resilience and mental toughness. Leaned down and added more muscle mass this season. Arm tackles are a waste of time. Carries heavy momentum behind pads at finish. Drops shoulder to punish final tackler. Uses wicked stiff-arm to punch and swat tacklers to the ground. Creates for himself through brute force. Natural power in lower half. Doesn't need a clean point of entry for aggressive, downhill charge. Excellent contact balance despite heavy shots on his legs. Short-yardage specialist who can move the chains and score touchdowns. Willing to leave his feet and sacrifice body near goal line. Willing blocker in pass pro and showed ability to come out of backfield in wheel routes, swing passes and outs."," Needs a clean slate of blocks to consistently make his way around the corner on the next level. Could struggle to accelerate from tacklers if he gets too cute. Runs with stiff hips and heavy legs. Lacks quick-escape athleticism for sudden shake in open field. All power, no finesse. Early defensive penetration short-circuits his run. Average lateral movement and not desired amount for every-down back. Can be a little slow to process moving parts in front of him. Not a press-and-cut back and needs to learn to set blocks up better. Hands a little stiff as pass catcher and will fight the ball at times. Tape shows occasional confusion in blitz pick-up. Medical concerns will continue to follow him.", Rounds 5-6, T.J. Duckett," Physical, battering-ram style runner who makes the hitting a two-way affair. Conner's lack of speed and reactive quickness could limit his role as a pro, but his heart, work ethic and ability to keep the chains moving could make him a red-zone specialist with the ability to handle some third down duties as well."
Jamal Adams,S," Natural-born leader of men. Well-built. Will not hesitate for one second as a hitter. Steps downhill looking to punish running backs to set a tone for defense. Toggles between patient and urgent in treks to the ball. Plays off blockers. Approaches target with open arms and wide, balanced base to limit escape routes. Intelligent field general. Gets secondary aligned properly. Plays with plus balance in coverage. Pattern reader who can digest combinations. Alert for misdirection keys from offense. Party crasher on screen plays. Can handle coverage responsibilities against tight ends. Five interceptions and two recovered fumbles over last two seasons at LSU. Special-teams terror as freshman and sophomore, notching 21 tackles. No penalties in 2016. Father, George, was a first-round pick of the Giants in 1984."," Handsy and too willing to clamp onto receivers down the field. Hard-charging downhill, but a little stiff when asked to retreat. Long speed appears to be average on tape. Eyes drop when targets approach his area. Anticipation is average, limiting his range as a center-fielder. Will give away some interceptions due to drops. Slower coming to balance as tackler on bursting runners between the tackles. Desire to limit cutbacks leads to challenging play-side tackles. Doesn't pursue with expected vigor from across the field. Aggressiveness opens him up against play-action.", Round 1, Darren Woodson, Interchangeable safety with a sheriff's mentality. Adams is a physical tone-setter who should thrive near the line of scrimmage or in a robber role. Should be a commanding presence in the locker room early on and his do-as-I-do play demeanor could be the catalyst for turning a struggling defense around quickly.
Jabrill Peppers,S," Athletic and fluid in space with desired change of direction talent. Moves with the changing flow of a play. Willing to sacrifice body to honor contain against run. Jack of all trades. Can play slot, safety or linebacker in sub-packages in any given game. Won't hesitate to race downhill once he diagnoses run. Hits with as much force as he can muster. Has big closing burst. Runs plays down from sideline to sideline. Able to knife into gaps and make tackles for losses or disrupt runs. Has man cover talent and is physical enough to handle most tight ends. Has enough quickness to match receivers. Aggressively re-routes receivers. Capable blitzer who buzzes in from all angles. Electric return man with ability to charge up crowd and his own sideline with big kick or punt return. Has experience carrying and catching the ball and as wildcat quarterback. Could offer red-zone flexibility on offense.", Scouts question his instincts and lack of ball production. Has just one interception and 10 passes defensed at Michigan. Slow to recognize construct of play and can be found playing through a straw at times. Needs better recognition and anticipation to become an improvising play-maker. Doesn't always trust his feet in coverage and will maul at the top of the route. Just a guy when asked to play deep safety. Slow to read and range until ball is in the air. Can be overzealous against play-action and drawn below his deep ball responsibilities. Too small for take-on duties at linebacker. Leads into tackles with ducked head. Opts to hit rather than wrap-up., Round 1-2, Eric Weddle," The ultimate Swiss Army Knife on the collegiate level, and will likely play a hybrid role on the next level that allows him to blitz, cover and chase, Peppers' draft value will be helped by his return ability and that is a role he should maintain throughout the earlier stages of his career. While Peppers doesn't have the production teams expect from first-round defenders, he should benefit from a role that is more clearly defined on the next level."
Elijah Qualls,DT," Has broad, thick hips. Possesses low center of gravity and plays with natural leverage. Has ability to control point of attack. Powerful upper body and can land a strong punch that sets a winning leverage point. Former high school fullback with nimble feet and surprising athleticism for his size. Has feet to overcome early reach block and work back into pursuit. Looks to pursue and run through the rib cage of a running back at impact. Two-gap reader with ability to eat space and brace up to double teams. Has ability to stuff wash-down blocks and cuts. Plays with good body control."," Body consists of stubby legs, short arms and a very soft middle with excess weight. Can be a little sluggish off the snap against lateral movement. Will get behind early in the rep. More adept at holding ground than making plays. Feet are nimble but hips are stiff. Unable to flip around the edge as pass rusher. Need to see more plays being made against run and pass. Stays glued to blockers for too long. Game lacks consistency of effort and production. Scouts say he has put on bad weight and needs to improve his work ethic.", Round 3-4, Corey Liuget," Athletic interior defender with the play traits and ability to play three-technique or nose tackle in the right scheme. Qualls' draft stock could be a hurt by a lack of desired length and a growing concern in scouting circles that he is a boom-or-bust prospect with concerns over his future weight and work ethic. He has the talent to become a solid, early-down run defender but is unlikely to ever factor as a pass rusher."
Eddie Vanderdoes,DT, His lone 2015 contest (vs. Virginia) showed off his enormous talent. His body type belies his surprising athleticism. Solid functional lateral movement and change of direction. Able to spin out of blocks with quick feet. Gives good chase along backside. Booming power in his hands to tilt rep in his favor after initial punch. Explodes hips into contact to dislodge blockers Has strength and ability to play nose tackle or three-technique. Can two-gap. Gets inside arm under and rag dolls move blocks to challenge cutback lanes. Grows roots against double teams and fights to split them rather than trying to survive. Brings toughness and edge to the workplace. Better rush potential than numbers indicate. Has strength to walk interior linemen back in the pocket.," Missed almost entire 2015 season with torn ACL and he didn't seem to bounce all the way back in 2016. Carries weight poorly in his upper body and especially midsection. Came into season with additional weight. Needs to eliminate 15-20 pounds to play at an optimal level. A little slow in reaction time off snap. Gets behind against move blocks and will often play from backside rather than play-side. Pad level rises after initial stages of rep. Needs to improve conditioning. Has to keep weight down and get full mobility back. Despite his ability, sack production has lagged behind.", Rounds 3-4, Ahtyba Rubin," Any evaluation of Vanderdoes is incomplete until studying 2014 and the Virginia game of 2015, but balancing that tape against his 2016 body of work will be the challenge. He's athletic and powerful, but his weight and health of his knee could be a concern. He has the talent to become a disruptive, productive starter if his body bounces back to his earlier form. If not, he's still a solid rotational defensive tackle."
DeShone Kizer,QB," Big quarterback with a big arm. Can make all of the throws. Has step and crank power to drive throws into the seams. Has the arm talent and willingness to challenge safeties on both intermediate and deep throws. Looks the part with thick frame to withstand NFL punishment. Over the top delivery creates tight spirals. Has powerful grip allowing for aggressive pump fakes to move defense around. When he's comfortable, will tie feet with his eyes as he scans the field. Adequate drive accuracy. If he feels a completion is imminent, he'll stand in and take a punishing shot. Strong, authoritative runner with the speed to hit a big play with his feet. Two-way threat in the red zone. Posted 18 rushing touchdowns over last two seasons.", Gets stuck on primary read missing out on early openers around field. May not have eyes or compact release to spot and hit flashing targets. Can be too reliant upon arm strength over mechanics. Wants open throwing window rather than operating with early anticipation. Can improve in leading receivers and throwing stationary targets open. Too hesitant. Gets caught in pump fake vortex at times. Quick to drop his eyes and halt progressions when pocket warms up. Inconsistent decision-maker. Showed dreadful lapses in judgement that lead to interceptions. Too willing to make off-balanced heaves. Benched against Stanford. Had at least one interception in 15 of his 23 starts. Will take a sack despite having ample time to read and throw., round 1-2, Steve McNair," The comparison to Steve McNair could raise eyebrows, but that is based primarily on size, mobility and arm strength. The aforementioned traits often land a quarterback in the first round, but Kizer's second-half drop in production combined with inconsistent decision-making and accuracy should be a speed bump for teams ready to jump in head-first on the traits. Kizer has the ability to become a quality starter, but has to improve his ball placement and field vision first."
Derek Barnett,DE," Championship hand fighter on college level. Hands are strong, fast, efficient and lethal. Punch-and-discard winner. As rusher, swats are well-timed discarding tackle's punch attempt. Attacks the edge with good forward lean and works hands and feet in harmony on road to the quarterback. Uses jab steps and lateral movement to search for the edge of the blocker. Has leverage and strength to play right through redirects. Elite production on par with former Vol and Hall of Famer Reggie White against run and as sack artist. Not content to just set the edge -- wants to make the play. Uses hand fighting and play strength to work through leverage points. Long strider who can crash down the line to challenge gap plays if unblocked. Punishing hitter. Delivers crushing tackles and sacks when given the opportunity. Hustle player who pursues the play with intent. Rag-dolls tight ends at point of attack. Plus field awareness recognizing play-action, reverses, and screens. Fluid enough to drop into space and play some zone."," Admitted slow starter who has had issues with sluggishness to start a season. Will overthink it at times rather than just reacting. Can be undisciplined with guessing snap count and taking penalties. Change-of-direction issues typical of a broad-waisted big man. Struggles to redirect movements suddenly once momentum starts rolling downhill. Quarterbacks with pocket mobility can elude him. Substantially more twitch in hands than in feet. Feet are average. Initial burst upfield is average. Times snap count to help with his get-off. Aggressive forward charge opens him up to cut blocks. Long stride creates base inconsistencies at point of attack. Length is a concern. Can he still win without decisive, early victories with his hands? Loops to quarterback are rounded and might need a winning, inside counter move as a pro.", Round 1, Nick Perry," Strong edge presence with NFL-caliber hand usage and play strength. Barnett is one of the most productive defensive linemen to come out of the SEC in quite some time despite lacking the length and twitch that teams usually look for off the edge. His awareness and play traits should keep him near the action and he has the talent to step into a starting base end spot right away. There could be coordinators who view him as an early down, outside backer in a 3-4 with the ability to put his hand in the ground on sub packages."
Ashton Lampkin,CB, Played in various coverages and has rare experience of playing some press coverage in the Big 12. Shows patience from press coverage. Can wait for receivers to release before opening hips. Decent feet and hip fluidity to mirror and match in space. Can flip hips and hit his top gear quickly. Takes good recovery angles on post routes.," Not a twitchy, explosive cornerback. Has issues with maintaining discipline from man and zone coverage. Gets caught staring down quarterbacks and will find himself out of position. Has a hitch at the top of his pedal when planting to drive on the throw. Delay in closing to ball will limit his production on the ball. Might not be able to carry long speed down the field. Disinterested tackler.", Round 7-PFA,," Average cornerback without a physical or play trait that he can plant his flag. Won't be physical enough against the run for some teams and will lack the size and deep speed for others. However, he's got decent size and is a relatively fluid athlete so he could hear his name called later in the draft. Might be fighting for a roster spot with each passing season."
David Njoku,TE," Great muscular definition with long arms and room for 10 more pounds. Elite athlete and seam buster deluxe. Can stick a foot in the ground and break in either direction at a 90-degree angle in shorter routes. Tremendous acceleration out of breaks to separate and widen the window for quarterbacks. Opens the throttle in open field. When he catches it on the move, the YAC yards can become an avalanche. Was 7 foot high-jumper in high school and can go up and over most everyone he faces. Hand quickness to get a last second push-off and still get hands up to secure catch. Finds soft spots against zones. Plays outside, from the slot and in-line. Willing to compete as a blocker. Can push defensive backs around from slot. Gets early arm extension into defender and looks to create some turn. Shows lateral blocking ability for zone scheme."," Inexperienced at the position and still a work in progress. Needs to add to his play strength to handle in-line blocking as a pro. Don't skip leg days, bro. Struggled badly to stay in front of Pitt powerhouse Ejuan Price. Hands too high and wide at point of attack. Inconsistent hands over two years at Miami. Focus drops were a problem. Had eight drops over last two seasons for drop rate over 11 percent. Speed allows him to uncover on downfield routes and hasn't had to learn nuances of setting up defenders with route work. Needs to get head around and find ball quicker when working over top of linebacker.", Round 1, Greg Olsen," Ascending pass catching talent with elite athleticism and enough fight in his run blocking to believe that he can be lined up anywhere on the field at any time. Njoku should annihilate the combine with monster numbers in speed and explosion, but his play on the field shows he's more than a combine warrior. He is still growing into his body and has to add to his play strength, but his playmaking potential and elite traits should make him a first-round pick and a future Pro Bowler."
Matt Dayes,RB," Runs with patience and presses line of scrimmage to set up his cuts. Outstanding peripheral vision with ability to find back-side cuts. Sees to second level. Operates with controlled, choppy feet in tight quarters for maximum body control. Subtle wiggle on second and third level to create more yardage. Able to gear down and make the sharp, downhill cuts on stretch plays. Solid pass-catching option.", Too small to be an every-down back. Runs with some hip tightness. Jump cuts and lateral escapability are below average. Doesn't accelerate into contact and is too easily tripped by arm tackles. Missing necessary strength in lower body to break tackles and create through power. Averaged just 1.8 yards after initial contact over last two seasons. Lacks long speed to finish the breakaway run., Rounds 5-6,," Tempo-based, one-cut running back with good vision but an inability to break tackles and run with power. Best on outside zone plays with an opportunity to find back-side cuts, but when he has to run between the tackles, he's missing an aggressive burst. Potentially a committee running back with some third-down value if he can tighten up his pass blocking."
Victor Salako,OT, Possesses a massive frame with good length to get into defenders. Plays with decent strength in his hands. Able to land a punch and latch on early in the rep. Frame provides him natural power to generate some early movement. Finds his way back inside against counter moves in pass protection. Utilized controlled approach to his target in run game., Straight-legged blocker with poor knee bend and overall leg stiffness. Plays out of an unorthodox pre-snap stance and pops straight up. Less a kick-slide that sluggish shuffle in pass sets. Allows defenders to live under his pads and gives initial ground against bull-rushers. Very narrow base as a run blocker and struggles to stay connected to his blocks. Balance is poor., UDFA,," Two-year starter at left tackle who utilizes his size and frame to compensate for his athletic deficiencies. Stiffness in lower half prevents him from playing with good balance and leverage in both running and pass blocking. While he has the size that will intrigue teams, his lack of functional athleticism could make it tough to find a long-term fit on the next level."
Damore'ea Stringfellow,WR, Plus body control. Can twist and turn in are and has impressive ability to finish the circus catch deep down the field. Big target with catch radius that is a big advantage. Can sink low to dig throws off the grass. Targets ball at the high point. Playing style very similar to former teammate Laquon Treadwell. Works aggressively back to the throw preventing the contested catch. Gave Alabama All-American cornerback Bobby Humphrey plenty of work in their early season matchup. Excels as a vertical threat when ball is in the air. Shows zone-beater tendencies underneath., Not much juice in his release and could become a jam target by physical cornerbacks. Can be uninspiring with his routes. Could use more sharpness and urgency into and out of the top of his routes. Is slow and labored sinking into his break for comeback routes. Lacks foot quickness to uncover on short throws. Scouts question his long speed; might need extended runway to reach top gear. Hands were inconsistent in 2016 season. Won't look for extra work as a blocker., Round 6, Tre McBride," Big receiver with average speed but an ability to track the ball and win it at the high point. Might not ever be dynamic enough to be a dangerous starting target, but he has the body control and competitiveness to work the second and third levels with some success. Improved route-running should improve his separation ability but average starter might be his ceiling. His best fit could be with a West Coast offense."
Noble Nwachukwu,DE," Agile and explosive. Bursts out of stance and plays with urgency. Rushes with early shoulder turn and generates some speed-to-power. Has quick inside move.

Tackles with arm length can get into his frame and re-route his rush attack. Pass-rush production took noticeable dip from 2015 totals. Can get stuck at top of his rush. Needs to learn how to clear his frame more effectively when blockers latch on. Early arm extension into bull-rush hinders full power potential. Needs to add creativity to his pass-rush repertoire. Delayed acceleration in his change of direction. Takes him time to ramp up and chase quarterbacks when sucked up by early play-fake., Round 5-6, Pernell McPhee," Might be considered a ""tweener"" in some circles and certainly lacks the length teams look for along the edge, but his quickness off the snap and plus motor could allow him to play despite size limitations. He's athletic enough to play a stand-up role on base packages and then rush with his hand down in sub-packages. Can compete for a backup role early and has the talent to become an eventual starter."
Dalvin Cook,RB," Uses choppy feet and compact stride length downhill. Keeps feet under him and is able to make lateral cuts at a moment's notice. Flourished in zone, gap and power schemes at FSU. At his best running wide while setting up lead blockers. Slows flowing safeties and linebackers with hesitation steps and glances back inside. Has run-away gear around the corner he keeps tucked away for special occasions. Darting style allows him to escape defenders who show gap commitment too soon. Plus vision. Quick to flow from first to second read on outside zone plays. Greedy redzone runner with ability to cash those checks. The brighter the lights, the bigger his game. Comfortable in both one-back and two-back groupings. Rare ability to cut it all the way back across the grain. Changes direction with degree of subtlety on second level without gearing down. Not much of a dancer. Tends to get hit it up the field. Feet in constant state of motion. Despite drops, can be dangerous out of backfield.", Not always a tough inside runner.

Will duck head and finish a run prematurely rather than probing for more interior space. Not always small through the crease. Flashes ability to finish with authority but makes business decisions at times. Hips not as fluid as expected. Would benefit from use of a hearty stiff-arm. Inconsistent hands in all phases. Ball security issues with 13 career fumbles. Suffers from focus drops out of backfield. Won't square-up on blitzers and may not be reliable enough as blocker to play on third downs., Rounds 1-2, Edgerrin James," Very talented runner with outstanding balance, footwork and burst. Cook lacks the power that you may find with some running backs in this year's draft, but he is a homerun hitter with a resume featuring monster games against his most highly regarded opponents. Cook creates for himself with elusiveness and speed, but his value could be diminished by injuries, character and issues in pass protection. If everything checks out, he could become a rookie of the year candidate right away."
Ben Boulware,ILB," Team captain. Brings leadership and confidence to the unit. Compact and physical. Plays with good balance through contact. Stands in to take on linemen to leverage his run gap. Knows how to utilize hands to keep himself clean. Plays with wide base and choppy, controlled shuffle in his scrape. Tough guy. Good football instincts against the pass.

Competent, productive special teams cover guy his first two seasons at Clemson."," Plays with some stiffness and lacks desired burst to the ball. Can be feast or famine with downhill gap shots against run. Has short arms and can be engulfed by size. Eyes will see it, but responsive twitch can be a step slow. Occasionally loses track of ball carrier in mass of bodies in front of him. Has average lateral quickness and can be a little slow to mirror running back from gap to gap. Heavy feet in change of direction. Doesn't gain depth quickly in his drops after early bite on play fakes.", PFA,," Tough and highly competitive. Has the attitude and swagger for the position but lacks the desired size and quickness. Margin for error might be too small to become a starter in the league, but his potential on special teams could be a way to open the door to an NFL career."

Talented work-up blocker who finds his second-level targets and strikes with accuracy. Can get to the difficult angles. Will work to bend knees after engagement to improve his leverage. Quick to flip hips and wall off his man. Works well with guards in handoff on combo blocks. Plays with good determination and effort. Rides the bull as long as he can after engaging with bigger defenders. Has tackle feet to mirror pass rushers along interior., Has short arms. Unlikely to offer tackle flexibility on roster due to a lack of length. Will need to add more bulk to prepare for NFL battles. Below average core strength. Finds himself hanging on rather than improving positioning. Finesse player in need of stellar technique without addition of play strength. Unable to create push at the point of attack without help. Can improve with securing on second level. Season-ending foot injury will have to be cleared at combine., Round 7-PFA, Wesley Johnson," An athletic center with the plus athleticism of a three-year tackle, but he lacks the core power that some teams will require from an interior lineman. Needs to bulk up and add as much strength as possible in order to be a functional NFL player. While his movement skills will be enticing for zone-scheme teams, he could be limited by scheme fit, which narrows the teams who might consider drafting him."
D'Onta Foreman,RB," Outstanding athleticism for a big runner. Smooth lateral movement. Has feet and agility for slide and go cuts from one gap to the next without a noticeable gear down. Finesses run lanes with subtle shifts and turns. Measured stride length optimizes balance. Swivels hips to swerve away from second level linebackers.

Jars linebackers and safeties at impact with his size alone. North-south runner. Rarely caught taking a loss due to ill-advised ""bounce"" outside. Proved he could shoulder heavy workload while cranking out consistent production week after week. Had tremendous conversion rate when short yardage was needed.", Usually opts for finesse over power despite his size. Needs to become more decisive and aggressive between the tackles. Inconsistent acceleration into contact. Waits to churn feet until after blow has landed. One pace runner. Forced into 30 or more carries in six of his last seven games. Needs to press the line a little longer on inside zone carries. Impatient keeping runs play-side and looks to break back inside prematurely. Almost overly committed to original running track rather than being flexible with his reads. Burst is average through the line allowing defenders to get hands on him. Alarming ball security issues this season with seven fumbles and six lost. Poor mechanics in pass protection. Doesn't square assignments defaulting to lazy shoulder blocks., Round 2-3, Jonathan Stewart," Former three-star recruit who turned that a chip on his shoulder into a 2,000-yard junior season. Foreman has outstanding foot quickness and wiggle for a back his size, but will need to run behind his pads and with more aggression on the next level. Teams could be split on his draft value as some may covet his size and athleticism while others will be concerned about a lack of third down value. Ultimately he has the talent to be a good NFL starter, but he's still a work in progress."
Marcus Maye,S, Ready-made safety frame with muscular build and long arms. Really instinctive with above-average field vision and feel for the game.

Balance can be a little spotty and he'll fight his hips when forced to transition suddenly on combination routes. Better coming downhill than playing on his heels. Missed final three games of senior season with broken arm.", Round 2, Glover Quin, Interchangeable safety with the instincts of a free safety and the physicality of a box player. Thrives as a downhill player and has the instincts and speed to operate effectively from both single-high and two-deep looks. Has the physical attributes and intelligence to step into a starter's role early on and will be a strong contributor on special teams.
Kevin King,CB, Rare height for the position. Solid job of restricting catch window on routes outside the numbers. Shoves receivers toward boundary and drifts into their running lane to decrease catch opportunity. Length creates challenge for receivers used to winning at the high point. Instinctive with good feel for finding football. Allowed just one touchdown over last 101 targets. Six career interceptions with hands to make the circus pick. Patient from press coverage. Quick to turn and locate once his back is to the quarterback. Saw increase in pass breakups in senior season. Willing to get physical with blocking receivers when it comes time to disengage and make a tackle. Has played all four spots in secondary and slot corner as well., Timed speed and play speed are both concerns. Sluggish feet in press allow quick-releasers to shoot past him. Unable to find necessary acceleration for functional makeup speed. Hands are flimsy in his jams. Could use more upper body strength. High center of gravity makes sudden change of direction a challenge. NFL ball production could be a concern. Takes path to his man over paths to the ball. Lacks desired twitch for NFL transitioning to the throws. Takes too long from bail technique and backpedal to plant and burst on the ball. Ankle biter willing to engage in too many arm tackles and blind shoulder rolls., Round 1-2, Damian Swann," Unusually tall cornerback with experience playing in the slot and as a starting safety. Showed improved instincts and ball production in 2016, but there are still concerns about whether he has the athleticism and recovery speed to utilize his length to play the football. Might be best suited to more zone coverage or off-man based on his speed limitations, but in either scheme he'll need to improve his aggressiveness as a tackler."
Christian McCaffrey,RB," Smooth, controlled stride length with choppy feet for instant cuts and change of direction. Plus vision with above average anticipatory feel for opening creases. Hugs contours of the running lane and staggers and stutters his feet to maneuver in tight quarters. Protect football while running through traffic. Reads keys quickly on stretch plays. Sinks hips into sharp cuts. Equally adept darting inside or outside and is able to string moves together. Won't dance on short runs -- gets it downhill. Feet constantly in motion. Able to make defenders miss on all three levels. Willing to keep runs playside and alters his track seamlessly. Runs with multiple gears and is able to gear up or down instantly. Has experience in one-back, two-back and offset formations. Excellent hands out of backfield and can be used from slot. Devastating quickness out of breaks can mismatch linebackers. Experienced, capable punt and kick returner."," Lacks desired size of an every-down back. Has some tread worn off his tires. Logged 300-plus touches (including returns) in each of the last two seasons and was asked to grind the gears for short yardage carries. Benefitted from physical, downhill offensive line. Takes foot off gas into contact. Doesn't have NFL-caliber power to break tackles and create yardage for himself through power. Can shake tacklers, but lacks a twitchy burst to accelerate away after the cut. On stretch plays, can get too cute continuing to probe towards the perimeter rather than choosing a crease and committing. Average burst may not be enough to race past NFL speed on second level. Inconsistent squaring up blitzers in pass pro and ducks his head into contact.", Round 1, Tiki Barber," Multidimensional runner with flex appeal for teams looking for a player who can carry the ball 20 times or catch it 10 depending on the game plan. McCaffrey's size, power and speed are just average, but he is able to create yardage for himself with his vision and elusiveness. McCaffrey's ability to return punts and kicks could be the value sweetner that pushes his name into the first round."
Isaac Asiata,OG," Big body for the interior. Adds roster flexibility. Has played both guard spots and can play center if needed. Plays with outstanding aggression on the field. Doesn't just look for extra work, he demands it. Hard worker. Gives maximum effort to take the lead in early portion of a block. Effective lateral skip step puts him in position to make his reach blocks. Rarely gets cheated on initial contact, landing powerful shoulders that jar defenders. Has power to uproot defenders in base blocks. Sets shallow anchor in pass pro against bull rushers. Has reactive quickness to handle blitzes and twists.", Playing style can be too frenetic. Will allow his aggression to pull him out of proper blocking position at times. Needs to quiet his flailing hands. Excessive hand fighting prevents him from snatching and securing blocks. Leads with upper body onto second-level blocks and loses balance if he doesn't land a strike. Base narrows as drive blocker and can be thrown off his block upper body tosses from defenders. Lacks body control for sustained engagements., Rounds 3-4, Jeremiah Poutasi," Aggressive and powerful with an ability to create space for running backs in a power scheme. Asiata isn't a complete stiff from a movement standpoint, but he loses effectiveness the farther he's asked to travel from his home base. He'll fall off of blocks a little earlier than teams will want, but his ability to generate movement combined with his girthy frame means he could become a starter at either guard or center within a couple of years."
Charles Walker,DT, Disruptive and productive as a sophomore in 2015. Can be tough to handle when motor is cranked and he's working the gaps. Comes off the snap with good get-off.

Effort level and motor fluctuates. Was a relative non-factor in all four of the games he played. High cut and struggles to maintain his ground against double teams. Lacked urgency as a pass rusher that he showed in 2015. Needs to add a rush counter when initial charge is foiled. Will lay on blocks at times. Needs quicker shed with tackle-ready posture., Rounds 6-7, Clinton McDonald," Disruptive defensive tackle with the initial quickness and power to become a factor for a one-gapping, upfield front if he can ever put it all together. Despite his flashes, Walker's career starts can be counted on one hand and 2016 was a complete loss of a season. NFL personnel men are likely to get harsh reviews from the Sooners coaching staff and teams will need to do their work on Walker's concussion situation, but his athleticism and potential give him a chance to become an NFL starter."
Deatrich Wise,DE," Uncommon arm length (35 inches) with enormous hands. Terrific power in his punch and is able to jolt tackles with it. Uses brute force to set a strong edge. Can rag-doll blockers with stack-and-jerk upper body power. Effective use of arm length to keep blockers out of his frame. Heavy tackler engulfing ball carrier with full weight of his frame.

Needs active feet after contact. Lacks edge rush ability to stay outside on third downs., Rounds 4-5, Malliciah Goodman, Slow-twitch power player with rare physical attributes but a lack of functional athleticism to chalk up a stat sheet. Might have been miscast as a 4-3 defensive end considering his lack of quickness and rush talent. But his length and power at the point of attack could make him an attractive Day 3 (Rounds 4-7) draft option for 3-4 teams looking for a two-gapping defensive end with the traits to bounce back from a disappointing senior season.
Charles Harris,OLB," Long legs with well defined bubble. Has loose, fluid hips. Explodes out of his stance in search of gap work vs. run game. Lateral quickness makes it a challenge to reach him or cross his face for offensive linemen. Good first step quickness. Plays with energy and keeps it cranked up until the whistle blows. Runs with high knees and athletic, long strides in the open field. Basketball standout in high school who uses nimble feet for an effective spin move. Can unleash spin counter in either direction. Plays on either side of the line and can play with a hand down or standing up. In 2015, led team in sacks, tackles for losses and hurries and was second in tackles. Uses early speed-to-power to create movement before attacking the tackle's inside shoulder.

Hands must get better at point of attack. Needs to punch and own the point. Rides on blocks rather than shucks them. Lacks desired glass-chewing mentality against the run. Plays with slow reaction time to counters and misdirection and can lose track of the ball. Needs earlier shoulder turn as rusher to prevent early pass sets from punching him as squared-up rusher. Slow to activate his counter spin back inside. More violent approach with hands at top of his rush would help grease the edge. Productivity dropped after struggling with new defensive scheme., Round 1, Connor Barwin," High-cut pass rusher with good athleticism but concerns regarding his ability to drop anchor against the run. Ironically, Harris might be best suited as a penetrator which is something he fought against this season. His hands can be improved as pass rush weapons, but he has agility and footwork that can't be taught. Harris can play on the edge in a 4-3 or 3-4 front and should be the next in a line of early contributing defensive ends coming out of Missouri."
Ejuan Price,DE, Quick-twitch athlete with elite playmaking production over last two seasons. Stutter steps and head fakes in rush approach causes uncertainty for tackles. Able to juke inside and bounce back out to create an edge opening as rusher. Built low to ground and plays strong through redirect blocks to trim the edge.

Face-up rusher missing upper body flexibility and hip flip. Needs soft edge to turn the corner., Round 5-6, James Harrison," Stiff-hipped, straight-line rusher who is limited in his rush approach, but has the burst and twitch to finish what he starts. The comparison with James Harrison has more to do with the stature, playing style and rush production that both men possess. While his draft stock might be limited, he has the ability to be a sub-package rusher who could flash on the next level."
Carlos Henderson,WR, Drops hips into breaks for sharp stop-and-open. Maintains play speed through directional route changes. Can elevate catch focus when he knows safety is coming to deliver a blow.

Play speed is inconsistent. Has quality top gear but doesn't always use it in his routes. Needs to do better job of tilting defenders with quality route work on next level. Too reliant upon speed and talent over fundamentals at this point. Ran simple routes and drew quarterback's ire when he made wrong reads on choices. Tight hipped and average at changing direction. Below average ball tracking on deep throws. Occasionally mistimes leaps. Waits on throws rather than working back to them. Focus drop come primarily on slants., Round 3-4, Quinton Patton," One-year superstar who delivered monster numbers at Louisiana Tech this year before leaving school early. Plays outside for the Bulldogs, but a little smaller than most teams will like. Henderson excels on catch-and-go throws and nine routes. He lacks the route running to come in and be an effective threat right away, but his kick return ability could get him early work."
Cam Robinson,OT," Outstanding, proportional frame with combination of thickness and athleticism. Fires into his target with a forceful pop generating early power and push.

Works and climbs to second level with controlled, stalking footwork. Has initial quickness to pull and land on defenders in space. Athletic enough to slide over and catch inside challenges. Usually works feet into position pre-contact in run game. Good length and gets adequate extension in his punch. Kick slide generally balanced and gains necessary ground to the edge. Has feet necessary to mirror edge speed and flatten them over rush arc. Glass-eater who fights hard to the whistle."," Balance issues a concern. Struggles with active, high-motor defenders. At times he ducks head into his run blocks, losing sight of a moving target. Narrow in-line power base due to lack of bend and excessive leaning. Weight creeps too far past his feet in both run and pass blocks. Inconsistent sustaining his block. On the ground substantially more than a tackle should be. Has to learn to run his feet under him at contact. Can improve as move blocker with better angles. Feet go dead when punching from shallow pass set. Gets caught punching from balls of his feet and without much bend allowing speed-to-power rushers to heat him up. Questionable instincts. On twists, dives down with defensive ends and will miss loopers around edge.", Round 1, Ereck Flowers," Five-star recruit and three-year starter at left tackle who is a road grader with impressive power at the point of attack and enough athleticism to function in diverse run schemes. Robinson has tape galore against SEC edge talent either playing in the NFL or who soon will be. The tape shows a player with the traits and physical ability to be a good NFL tackle, but his balance issues and inconsistencies as a pass protector are a concern. Robinson is a candidate to be overdrafted due to the position he plays and his size, but buyer beware as some of his deficiencies might not be easily correctable."
Jayon Brown,LB," Operates with a patient scrape to wide-flowing plays. Can ramp up play speed. Able to range from sideline to sideline but will come downhill to meet running backs in their own living room, too. Finds his way to the ball and is a consistent finisher despite his lack of size. Active and instinctive in coverage. Anticipates throwing lanes and rushes to jump in. Finished with 15 passes defensed over last three seasons, including three interceptions. Four years of special teams experience."," Very small. Built more like a strong safety. Play strength is below acceptable norm. Gets bounced off his mark badly when taking on blocks. Unable to leverage his gap and will have to be a run-around linebacker to make plays. Is active as a tackler, but has to go along for a ride to get big backs down. Scouts say instincts against the run need improvement. Never forced a fumble in college.", Round 6-7,," Undersized WILL linebacker with good production as a tackler and against the pass his senior season. Brown's speed ability to play on special teams will give him a fighting chance for a roster spot, but he lacks the functional strength to become anything more than a sub-package cover linebacker."
Christian Brown,DT," Good interior athlete. Flashes some twitch in his movements. Comes off the snap with a lively step and has quickness to beat blockers across their face. Good upper body power to press blockers off of chest and create arm extension. Able to shed blockers with some quickness when needed. Has pop in his initial punch to rattle opponent's pads. Has experience at nose, three-technique and five-technique. Finds running backs quickly and tries to mirror their gap choice. Batted down four passes, recovered two fumbles and blocked a kick in final season at WVU.", Pad level creates unnecessary problems for him. Inconsistent anchor. Allows blockers underneath his pads and can be driven off his spot. Base and balance could use improvement. Initial punch will miss the mark and land up high on opponent's pads. Has been relative non-factor as pass rusher. Plays the blocker rather than working past him. Rushes with excessive movement without really gaining ground. Needs to play with better composure; had four penalties for unsportsmanlike conduct and late hits., PFA,, Athletic defensive tackle who has been more solid than good. Brown lacks the size along the interior but does come off the ball with some quickness and has moldable attributes. Brown has enough ability to become a rotational interior defender if a team can help him iron out his pad-level issues.
Caleb Brantley,DT," Compact frame with lean muscle mass and thickness in his arms and legs. Has tremendous play strength and can dislodge guards with hip torque. Plays hungry and with passion. Able to plant his flag and stand his ground against double teams. When he gets the snap timed up, it's over. Has the initial quickness and play strength to get into the gap and plow through any and all redirect block attempts. Wants blocker to feel the power in his initial punch. Works off blocks and towards the play. Better pass rusher talent than sack total would indicate. Quick punch and pry opens blockers' edge allowing him to wedge into the pocket. Efficient mover with no wasted motion. Considers one-on-one blocks a sign of disrespect.", Straight-liner and slightly undersized. May need to add more mass on his frame. Doesn't possess the lateral agility or quickness to excel as a rusher in twists up front. Not a dynamic pass rusher. Needs to add a counter move for when his power rush stalls out. Has to prove he can handle extended snap count. Part of deep defensive line rotation and was usually kept fresh. Misses out on sacks and tackles for losses due to lack of length to consistently finish when he gets near the play. Guesses snap count. Drawn offsides 10 times over the last two seasons., Rounds 6-7, Aaron Donald," Powerful, stout defensive tackle with the quickness to play the three-technique and the power to play the nose. Brantley has the talent and traits that should appeal to both two-gap and one-gap defenses. While we haven't seen Brantley play in even half of Florida's defensive snaps in a single year, the talent is there to become an early starter and a defensive force up front. On April 13th, Brantley was involved in a physical altercation with a woman that resulted in the woman being knocked unconscious. Brantley was charged with a misdemeanor and could now go undrafted."
Mitchell Trubisky,QB," Adequate height with good muscular definition. Built to withstand physical challenges of the position. Calm field general. Very good pocket mobility. Can slide around circumference of the pocket without having to drop his eyes from their task. When he leaves the pocket, looks to challenge with his arm before defaulting to his feet. Always in ready-to-rip throwing posture. Delivery is crisp and efficient. Locates safeties and reads their intentions immediately after the snap. Quick through his progressions and will double back to targets if his protection allows him time. Pocket mechanics and throwing motion are solid. Tough and competitive. Shows courage and poise in the pocket. Throws passes from balanced platforms and rarely defaults to an off-balance throw unnecessarily. Has all the arm you need. NFL call sheets will be wide open with Trubisky at the helm. Can dial up deep field-side outs with accuracy. Ball comes humming out of his hand when he needs to spike his velocity. Arm talent to whip a catchable throw from difficult angles to targets outside the numbers. Makes the standard ""pitch and catch"" throws with consistent accuracy. Ball usually comes out on time. His 62.1 completion percentage on intermediate throws easily outpaces the top quarterbacks in this draft. Possesses get-away quickness to avoid sudden pressure from a-gap blitzers with the speed to damage the defensive cause once he leaves the pocket.", Almost 98 percent of his dropbacks came from shotgun. Will have to learn NFL footwork from under center which could take time. Benefits from offense loaded with RPOs (run-pass option) that pull linebackers forward and open easier throwing windows. Played in space-based passing attack that didn't often ask him to throw to tight windows in traffic. Arm slot will drop way down causing batted balls at line of scrimmage. Too willing to float balls rather than air-mailing them out of bounds when he's making a bail-out throw against pressure. Needs better drive accuracy between the hashes. Has a tendency to leave throws in hip pocket of moving targets. Inconsistent deep ball touch. Has touchdown opportunities he babies and invites defenders time to recover. Not always pocket aware. Hyper-focuses on shifting parts down the field and can be late to feel pressure collapsing the edges., Round 1, Matthew Stafford," Trubisky is a high-end quarterback prospect who possesses NFL size, a big arm and the ability to throw with accuracy from the pocket or on the move. Despite playing in a spread-based offense, he's a full-field reader who does a very good job of getting an early read on the safeties before crafting his course of action. Trubisky will have to become much more pocket aware and do a better job of recognizing and attacking blitzes to back NFL defensive coordinators off. He hasn't put all the pieces together yet, but the puzzle is all right in front. Trubisky projects as a good starting quarterback with a high floor and the potential to be great."
Budda Baker,S," Tremendously explosive and passionate in his play. Former high school track sprinter with good play speed. Screams off the edge as a blitzer. Always bouncing on balls of his feet just waiting to race to the action on a dead sprint. Plays with smooth backpedal and diagonal shuffle. Has a shiftiness that allows him to mirror change of direction in space. Plus instincts from any coverage areas. Allows quarterback's eyes and pattern recognition to carry him around the field. Not easily pulled from coverage responsibilities by bait routes around him. Has the click and close ability of a cornerback in coverage. Ball skills are solid. Plays with exceptional aggression. Accelerates through receivers to jar the pass loose. Tackle finisher who races to the throw to end plays at the catch point. Scouts use terms like ""winner"" and ""top notch person"" to describe him.", Undersized safety in a smaller frame. Could struggle to carry 200 pounds as a pro. Gets big-boyed by tight ends from the slot. Lack of size may limit how NFL teams can use him. Aggressive shoulder rolls into running backs could cause future health issues. Force as a tackler just average against big running backs. Forced into grab and drag scenarios to get running backs down at times. Small hesitation to accelerate when forced to open and sprint down the field. Can be too overzealous when stepping downhill to tackle. May need to play with a little more discipline and control as an NFL tackler., Round 2, Bob Sanders," Undersized free safety with the heart of a linebacker. Baker plays with a competitive desire that leaps off the field when you watch him thanks to elite football character and above-average explosiveness. While he is undersized, he makes up for it with his football instincts and plus play speed. Baker has the talent to become a play-making safety with Pro Bowl potential if he can sustain his health."
John Ross,WR," Has home-run gear to yank the top off of defenses. Vertical speed demands respect and creates open throws underneath. Corners open hips early to turn and sprint, leaving his curl and dig routes unchallenged. Feet are fire. On verticals from the slot, sells the corner route and stems to the post with a burst for easy separation and a comfortable throwing window for the quarterback. Hands are generally solid. Plus hand-eye coordination. Natural ball-tracker who locates the deep ball early and watches it. Dangerous show-and-go open-field ability after the catch. Able to win with slants or fades near the goal line. Eludes the first tackler and can turn a short one into a long one in a heartbeat. Has enough size to work from outside or from the slot. Saw four of his eight carries go for 15-plus yards. Has returned at least one kickoff for a touchdown in each of his three years at Washington.", Undersized with below-average play strength. Struggled to get into his routes cleanly and impact the game against the physical cornerbacks at Alabama. Weight will creep too far out over his toes at times. Tape shows occasional stumbles over nothing but turf in his routes and after the catch. Needs to do better job of working back to the throw. Has to learn to make contested catches. Will need to sharpen his short and intermediate routes to become a true three-level target. Has had a major injury to both knees. The long-term health of both knees will be a concern that has to be answered at the combine., Round 1, DeSean Jackson," Ross is an instant-impact weapon who scored 23 touchdowns in just 112 touches. He should be able to step right in as a kick returner and a slot receiver, but teams with speed at tight end might utilize him outside to create extreme vertical stress on opposing safeties. If his knees check out as healthy, Ross is a likely first-round pick with the rare ability to become a high-volume slot receiver or a lesser-targeted, high-yield deep-ball threat."
Bucky Hodges,TE," Outstanding combination of size and athleticism for the position. Smooth glider around the field. Runs fast and plays fast. Long target with extended catch radius. Can get up and over the top of most defenders at the high point. Willing to work over the middle and has the frame for it. Spent time at all receiver spots and could be an option from the slot as well as outside as a pro. Seam-beater who can get over top of linebackers and work all three levels of the field. Saw 28 percent of his catches go for 20-plus yards in 2016. Can access a second gear out of route stems. Once he stacks defender on his hip, he wins. Excellent ball tracker with second gear and hand usage for late separation down the field. Former quarterback with valuable knowledge of coverages. Will demand additional attention if covered by a cornerback near goal line. Shows strength to overwhelm defensive backs as a blocker."," Has played the position just three seasons and still has much to learn. Long strider who can be put into neutral by a physical jam from press. Too nonchalant along his routes. Needs to hit route landmarks more quickly to give quarterback a timely, presentable target. Defaults into running through defender rather than effectively adjusting routes. Throws beat him up at times this season. Struggled to finish challenging catches. Lower percentage of clean catches trapping throws against his body and double catching it. Athletic but takes awhile to access acceleration after catch and may not be the ""YAC"" people expect. May lack power and toughness to be a reliable in-line option as a blocker.", Round 3-4, Devin Funchess, Hodges still has work to do as a route-runner and his inconsistent hands could be a concern. He can line up inside or outside while his size and ability to work all three levels of the field should be appealing to teams looking for pass catching options. The competitive nature of the NFL could bring out more consistent toughness in him as a blocker. He has the tools to be a long-time starter and touchdown-maker in the league.
Davon Godchaux,DT, Gets out of his stance and into the blocker with good hip explosion. Plays with proper pad level at point of attack to create desired leverage. Hands-first striker who gets early arm extension. Utilizes hands and leverage for quality read-react positioning in the trenches. Hard to turn out of hole by single blockers. Well-coached. Has feel for double teams and looks to take them on quickly and with proper technique. Shows some early gap quickness when allowed to play upfield. Creates his best pass-rush opening with arm-over move. Decent pursuit quickness and makes attempts to chase down screen passes from backside., Short-limbed pass rusher with squatty build of a bulldog. Undersized for interior work. Has issues fighting off double teams. Has difficult time reaching through the edge and pulling himself over the top. Might need more snaps off as motor seems to lose gas. Guards with a strong anchor put his pass rush in neutral. Often last defensive lineman out of his stance. Not very instinctive. Guards able to reach and hook his outside shoulder to seal him on play-side. Needs quicker disengage to tackle. Sack numbers came against lesser competition., Round 2-3, Khyri Thornton," Undersized three-technique who played with the punch and arm extension to set a strong edge even though he might be a better fit for a one-gap unit. Options could be limited as he lacks the mass to hold up against double teams, and he might be missing the traits to create quick wins as a pass rusher. He projects as a 4-3 rotational tackle with very little sub-package value."
Artavis Scott,WR, Able to wall off defenders to protect the throw and make contested catches. Will cut slant short and sink into space if he sees linebacker ready to blow up the catch. Can return both punts and kicks. Adequate concentration when ball is in the air. Hands catcher who will pluck it away from his body. Extends to snare the high throw. Shows subtle shake after catch to make first responders miss. Drops pad into contact and falls forward for additional yardage at the finish. Had momentum shifting kickoff return against Louisville. Sure-handed as punt returner.," Catch-and-go target who tends to get what scheme offers him. Not particularly quick or fast. Missing kick out of his breaks for route separation. Routes lacking in vertical push and purpose. Needs to play at his top speed more often. At times, will drift in his routes relying on scheme and route combinations to open him up. Lacks length and long speed for vertical separation. This season, managed one catch out of eight targets beyond 21 yards. Missing sudden component teams desire from slot.", Rounds 5-6,," Too small and slow on the outside and lacks the suddenness and shiftiness that teams like from the slot. Scott has a competitive streak in him and made his share of big plays for Clemson, but he may lack the physical attributes to make an impact as a pro receiver. His ability to contribute on special teams will help, but a big combine might be necessary to bump his draft value even more."
Garett Bolles,OT," Elite athletic ability with the sweetest feet at the tackle position in this draft. Movement skills are smooth and unencumbered. There isn't an angle block he can't get to. Smooth climbs to linebackers as a work-up blocker, and has rare ability to accelerate from that block up to a third target. Has lateral quickness in run game to cross-face from backside and seal on the play-side. Can take quick settle steps, sinks and scoops defensive ends on base blocks. Quick feet allow for more patience to scan for stunts. Can meet edge speed with quick sets in pass pro. Plays with a mean streak and loves to finish. Outstanding change of direction to mirror without a hitch in his transition. Keeps weight on inside foot in his slides. Moves feet into position against inside counters. Balanced in his pass sets and keeps blocks centered. Should get bigger and stronger with more weight work after unorthodox path to the draft.", Frame is a little narrow and legs appear to be shorter than normal. Devoid of drive power in his lowers. Pad level rises and he struggles to generate much movement against stout outside linebackers at point of attack. Needs better knee bend into second-level contact. Inconsistent in sustaining his blocks. Power can toss him off balance. May be limited by scheme fit. Needs to keep hands inside to bolster strength in his base. Lacks trust in his core power against speed-to-power. Leans into blocks with feet behind him to brace up. Will need sharper punch and more sink in his sets. Gives initial ground against power and doesn't always anchor quickly. Will be 25 years old by opening of fall camp., Round 1-2, Cedric Ogbuehi," Because he's only played one year of FBS football and hasn't been able to fully fill out his frame over the last five years, Bolles will require a projection and conjecture than most of the tackles in this year's draft. He clearly has elite athletic ability and foot quickness, but his lack of core strength and ability to sustain blocks against power across from him is a concern at this time. While he has Pro Bowl potential for a zone-scheme team, his floor will be a little lower than you might like in an early round pick."
Anthony Walker Jr.,LB," Carries NFL thickness throughout his frame. Adequate straight-line pursuit speed. Flashes burst gear to close out runners looking to get the corner. Smart player with excellent work ethic. Considered a great teammate and leader. Instinctive downhill runner, and productive. Always looking to play tackles near the line of scrimmage. Works around second-level blocks with limp inside shoulder and upper body turn, causing blockers to miss the target and fall forward. Able to adjust path to the ball in space. Instinctive with good peripheral vision. Outstanding field awareness. Urgent helper on wide receiver screens and hitches. Plays with balanced eyes in coverage, darting between his coverage area and the quarterback's eyes. Crowds target in his area, but willing to come off and hustle to a passing lane if he reads pass. Has 16 passes defensed over his three years."," Has some stiffness in his movement. Has been too muscle-bound and tight at times during career. Got too big, too fast. Missed tackle total on the high side. Comes downhill with some rigidity in his feet that prevent quick, lateral shifts. Sluggish to redirect his weight to mirror shifty runners in the hole or in open field. Should continue to work on functional flexibility. Will need to meet lead blocks with better knee bend and more force. Take-on skills need work. Feet are ahead of his hands when taking on climbing linemen. Allows blockers into his frame rather than punching and maintaining distance. Struggles to play off blocks. Can be obliterated and erased from his gap by angle blocks.", Round 7-PFA, Kiko Alonso," Has packed muscle onto his frame that looks good in the uniform but might be limiting his flexibility and athletic ability. A productive, downhill linebacker who misses too many tackles and struggles as a take-on player. He checks all the desired boxes for football and personal character and can be counted on to do what it takes to improve his game. He could become a decent starting linebacker within his first few years."
Brad Kaaya,QB, Three-year starter and pro-style pocket passer. Experienced and comfortable under center and in play-action offense. Has shown an ability to read the entire field when asked. Gets through progressions fairly quickly. Expedites release and throws to an area in front of the route when blitz is closing in. Always looking to throw past sticks on third down. Understands his arm limitations and rarely takes unnecessary chances throwing into space. Rhythm passer comfortable working in timing-based passing attack. Schooled on mechanics of the position since he was eight years old. Uses well-timed climbs and slides to maneuver away from pressure. Footwork is consistent and well-rehearsed. Ball stays tucked under his ear until he cuts it loose with relatively quick wrist flick. Throws on balance with easy delivery. Delivers feathery soft deep ball with good trajectory and ability to drop the nose of the ball into a bucket. Gets ball out early on field-side throws to mitigate lack of velocity.," Accuracy and ball placement can be sketchy. Will rush throws and ""work early"" rather than throw with velocity into tight windows. Front side opens early, causing passes to sail. Consistently poor accuracy on intermediate work. Completed just 38 percent of his passes between 11-20 yards in 2016. Underthrows deep balls and fails to consistently hit crossers and slants in stride. Arm strength lags behind NFL norm. Throws hang in air or nose-dive prematurely when throwing field side. Rigid, mechanical approach as passer. Lacks arm talent and improvisational skills to create magic with off-balance throws on the move. Fails to see and exploit anticipatory throws between linebackers and safeties. Lacks mobility outside the pocket and will give into the pressure -- at times taking the sack rather than getting rid of the ball.", Round 3-4, Cody Kessler," Groomed to be a quarterback from an early age, Kaaya flashes the mechanics and intelligence of a player who has spent hours in quarterback camps. However, he can be too mechanical and thinks too much rather than just flowing and responding to what the field offers him. Kaaya could have used another year of college, but he has the tools and intangibles to become an NFL starter. While he can work around his average arm strength, he must improve his accuracy and anticipation if he is to make a mark in the NFL."
Vincent Taylor,DT, Fires out of his stance with some gas. Can win the early battle for neutral zone. Able to create push at point of attack and make plays on other side of line. Plus upper body strength. Bench-press numbers are impressive. Can toss blockers aside and win the gap late in the rep. Has long arms and active hands in passing lane. Motor is adequate and he'll give an honest chase to the ball. Not a stagnant rusher. Looks to find blocker's edge and has posted solid sack production," Top heavy with stiff ankles and an overall lack of functional flexibility in his play. Short-area quickness is somewhat limited. High center of gravity and narrow base allows blockers to wash him down in space and turn him out of his run fit with base blocks. Upright as a pass rusher and can be redirected too easily. Unable to gain ground with lateral movement, stunting his effectiveness in twist game as pass rusher.", Rounds 6-7,," Taylor has consecutive seasons of good production in the pass-happy Big 12, but he lacks the consistent contact balance and anchor that teams will be looking for from an interior defender. His ability to disrupt off the snap with quickness and strength gives him a chance to get a foot in the door as a rotational tackle."
Solomon Thomas,DE," Angular build, well-built frame. His mother, father and uncle were all collegiate athletes. Lined up at multiple positions. Has ravenous approach to the game. Gets out of the blocks quickly and attacks with early, skilled hands. Stays hungry and wants to feast. Powerful for his size. Shows ability to win with power or quickness. Outstanding athleticism. Fluid in his play. Transitions from move to move. Unpredictable pass rush. Attacks both the edges and can crank up a bull rush. Uses swipes, rips and arm-over to unlock his rush. Hands and feet work in unison. Has lightning-quick spin move he can access to unhinge from block and find new life in his rush. Violent disengagements from blocks leave no doubt blocker is whipped. Relentless approach combined with athleticism makes block recoveries extremely difficult in run or pass. Refuses extended engagements to blockers and works himself free. Will sniff out gaps and make himself skinny into the backfield. Very good pursuit speed and range as playmaker."," Considered a ""tweener"" by scouts, who believe he could struggle to keep enough weight on his frame to play along interior. Length is below average as five-technique. Plays with inconsistent pad level. Needs to get bigger and stronger through his lower body. Tends to play taller as play rolls along and can get washed out of plays by strong down blocks. Hands are quick but need more consistent pop behind them. Overall play strength can be improved. ""Big and strong"" across from him causes some issues. Gets engulfed at times. Snap-count guesser with seven offsides penalties in 2016.", Top-10 pick, Justin Smith," Explosive defender who combines strength, quickness, and a muscle-car motor to drive him around the field making play after play. Has the hands and feet to be a quick-win specialist and the size to fit as a 4-3 or 3-4 defensive end who can reduce inside for pass-rush downs. He has all the athletic traits to become a high-impact player and possesses more than enough skill and talent to believe he will continue to elevate his game as a pro. Thomas has the potential to become the best defender from this draft class and a future all-pro."
Alvin Kamara,RB," Spirited runner with NFL size and speed. Will open creases by varying pace of his runs. Burst to top speed is available at flip of a switch. Creates yardage with speed, wiggle and power. Twitchy and decisive. Strong lower body provides superior balance. Flexible and agile with ability to twist, spin and ricochet off of bodies and continue to gain yards after contact. Very productive; 23 touchdowns in just 284 touches at Tennessee. Well-liked inside program and a team leader. Can play on all three downs. Improved in pass protection and squares up blitzers. Has lined up at slot receiver at times. Sure-handed pass catcher with excellent burst out of breaks to consistently uncover. Has talent as punt returner."," Vision can be hit or miss. Not an instinctive runner. Needs to see running lane develop and is missing a feel for reading progressions of his blocks. Makes inconsistent decisions on stretch plays. Can be his own worst enemy on third level. Will run himself into a tackler rather than setting him up for a downfield blocker. Consistently cuts left when given an open-field choice against tackler. With knee injuries in his background, combine medicals could come into play. Needs to tuck ball high and tight to prevent fumbles.", Round 2, Thomas Jones," Ascending, competitive runner who has flashed explosive NFL talent at various times over the last two seasons. A committed runner with excellent balance who finds yardage that isn't blocked for him. While he has never logged 20 carries in a single game, he has the talent to play on all three downs if he can prove his durability."
Matthew Godin,DT," Very good size with decent length. Despite his height, comes out low from his stance and into contact. Has some pop in his hands at the point of attack. Has enough strength to battle back against single blocks. Gets shoulder turned and can drive into a gap to muddy the rush lane. Can set a decent edge if he gets his hands in first.", Run-only player offering nothing in pass rush. Lacks feet and bend to improve his positioning much after contact. Rarely plays on the other side of the line. Able to play his area only and has very limited tackle radius. High center of gravity makes it difficult for him to withstand double teams. Below average college production., UDFA,," Possesses the size and length of an old-school five-technique, but his inability to rush the passer and range at all in space makes him ill-fitted to today's brand of NFL defense. He could get a look in camp due to his measurables, but it will be tough for him to find a long-term home."
Kermit Whitfield,WR," Gadget player who can be activated with jet sweeps, reverses and wide receiver screens. Kicks it into high gear quickly and is dangerous after the catch. Has speed to split two deep safeties from slot. Surprising body control for small receiver and can win the occasional 50/50 down the field. Is short, but with compact lower body. Was used in intermediate routes. Has kick return experience."," Routes are poor and runs them with almost no attempt to fool defenders. Relies on low center of gravity over sink and acceleration. Creates traffic for himself. Slants, outs and crossing routes all drift too low bringing cornerbacks and safeties into play at catch point. Body catcher with small hands.", PFA,," Lacks the route savvy and suddenness expected from the slot, but he does have talent after the catch which could appeal to teams looking for a gadget player. Kick return experience helps his cause, but may have to earn his shot as an undrafted free agent."
Tony Stevens,WR, Big target with excellent size. Has intriguing physical traits. Quick stop-and-open on comebacks for necessary separation. Can stride past deep safeties and into the clear on double moves. Long target with an expanded catch radius. Can climb the ladder and snare the would-be overthrow. Has some run after catch ability. Has some vertical potential.," Routes are run at 3/4 speed and appears to be counting steps. Must learn to play faster. Pops upright into his breaks. Hands are below average. Allows throws into his frame. Despite his size, struggles to finish contested catches. Hears footsteps over the middle. Route work was simple. Linear frame and battles to get off press. Play strength within routes is poor.", PFA,," Height, weight, speed prospect with limited production and below average hands. Thanks to his physical traits, there will likely be some teams interested in getting ahold of Stevens to see what he might be capable of, but it is unlikely they would be willing to spend a draft pick on him. Stevens has some practice squad potential."
Eric Saubert,TE, Good combination of size and speed. Gets into routes with good quickness from the slot. Adjusts route to defender and does a good job of setting up his pattern breaks. Good separation acceleration. Man amongst boys in red zone where he dominated lesser competition. Posted 17 touchdowns over last two seasons. Gets maximum extension out of long arms to attacks downfield throws at their highest points. Has ability to make acrobatic catches when he's focused. Used in wide receiver screens. Athletic runner after the catch. Lines up all over the field. Flashes ability to become a blocker in future.," Routes could use better knee bend to fight off redirections by linebackers. Short routes need attention to detail. Slow getting hands catch-ready on short, possession throws. Tape is littered with drops for days. Open catches became drops and contested catches became drops. Hand-eye coordination simply isn't where it needs to be. Doesn't always play to his size. Allows smaller defenders to crowd him in space. Inconsistent finishing routes. Run blocking isn't important enough to him. Gives half-efforts on secure blocks and doesn't look for work when uncovered.", Round 5-6, Jace Amaro, Tape study is absolutely maddening on Saubert as it roller coasters from eye-popping potential to lapses in concentration and effort as a blocker. Saubert's speed and athleticism will get him open and he should test well at the combine. Teams will have to balance the flashes with the drops and decide how early they want to pull the trigger on a tight end with starter's potential but a low floor.
Justin Davis,RB, Former high school sprinter and long-jumper with desired speed and athleticism at the position. Will hide behind blockers while he probes for points of entry along the line of scrimmage. Benefits from nimble feet. Quick to gather and cut downhill as zone runner and has the agility to stop on a dime and shake traffic in the backfield to keep runs moving. Good open field vision and elusiveness. Consistent and reliable., Needs more weight to be an early-down running back. Allows back-side tacklers to run him down. Will need to play with more consistent suddenness on the next level. Lacks authority as a runner. Gives into tackle rather than imposing his will and making a statement. Missing tackle-breaking power in hips. Ball security issues with three fumbles in 109 carries this year. Below average third down option as blocker and pass catcher., PFA,," Solid college running back who lacks the physicality to be a consistent interior runner and the blocking ability teams expect from their third down backs. Davis has decent vision and elusiveness once he gets up to the second level, but he lacks early creativity and typically gets what is blocked for him on the first level. He could get drafted on the third day but appears to be a garden-variety, replaceable runner."
DeAngelo Yancey,WR, Good size with sturdy frame. Averaged 19.4 yards per touch his senior season. Has build up speed and can climb over top if his runway is long enough. Active hands on vertical routes to create late separation. Can extend frame to pluck the high throw. Can track throws over his shoulder and watch them all the way in. Works away from cornerbacks on comebacks and hitch throws to create a cleaner window for quarterback. Will get in the way and run interference as a blocker., Short stepper missing quick feet to shake press coverage off the snap. Upright and slow into his routes. Stiff into his breaks with prolonged gear down. Lacks burst out of breaks and double moves aren't quick enough to create the easy throwing window. Quality man coverage can smother him. Failed to catch at least 50 percent of targeted throws in any season at Purdue. Vertical sell to setup short and intermediate is unconvincing. Drops have been an issue throughout his career., Round 7-PFA,," Four year letterman who has relied on quantity for his production totals. Yancey is a stiff-hipped vertical receiver only with good size but below average hands. A team could sniff around on him on Day 3, but he will struggle to uncover against NFL man coverage."
Sam Tevi,OT, Has starting experience at both left and right tackles. Displays good foot quickness in his pass sets and operates from consistent base width. Able to meet speed at the edge in pass protection. Converted defensive tackle and has a little bit of edge in his play. Downblocks have some kick in them. Works well with guards. Big hands with decent strength.," Helmet blocker who ducks head into contact in both run and pass blocks. Doesn't throws hands quickly enough and they land higher than he's likely aiming. Despite foot quickness, fails to consistently find position on back-side blocks. Plays with stiffness in knees which creates pad level issues. Weight too far outside in his pass sets and can be rocked off-balance by stab moves and bull rushes. Way behind on his work against twists.", Rounds 6-7,, Has decent size and enough athletic ability to warrant a look as a swing tackle. His lack of anchor in the passing game and instincts against twists could be big problems for offensive line coaches.
Austin Rehkow,P," Handles punting, kickoff and field goal duties at Idaho. Accuracy has continued to improve. Has hit 16 of 20 (80 percent) from 40-plus yards over the last two seasons. Has posted very good hang time numbers as a punter during his career. Saw fair catch percentage spike from 21.6 to 35.1 this year. Has excellent feel for touch punts. Landed impressive total of 49.1 percent inside the 20-yard line and 28.1 percent inside the 10-yard line.", May not have enough leg to make it as NFL field goal kicker. Has made just one of five field goal attempts of 50-plus yards during his career. Lacks combined leg strength and hang time to handle full-time kickoff duties. Snap-to-punt time can get a little quicker., PFA,," Rehkow's NFL future is as a punter, but his ability to handle the kicking duties if called on will surely add to his draft value and overall slotting. His hang time and accuracy numbers could be good enough to land Rehkow a spot in this year's draft."
Avery Moss,DE," Long-limbed and does something with it. Can be slippery with ability to slide off a centered block and work towards the edge. Pulls himself around a block. Very good athlete with loose, explosive hips. Twitch to disengage quickly and lay into a ball-carrier. Recruited by colleges as basketball player as well. Can unlock and chase to the perimeter or from the backside with plus acceleration. Combines upper body flexibility, foot quickness and length for fast wins in pass rush. Shoulder dip around edge is his go-to move. Burst to the quarterback will catch your eye.", Too reliant upon athleticism at point of attack. Needs to learn to set and control the edge with greater force. Underdeveloped instincts against the run. Plus arm length is somewhat negated by basic hand skills as pass rusher. Hands work a little wide and go dormant at the top of the rush. Hasn't learned to clear his frame when blockers land first. Wasn't challenged enough since move from Nebraska. Character must be vetted. Banned from Nebraska's campus in 2014 following 2012 incident where he exposed himself to female student., Round 7-PFA, Robert Ayers, Moss is an ascending prospect who possesses the length and juice off the edge expected of open-side rusher. His big closing burst can be felt against both the run and pass and he translates to either 4-3 defensive end or 3-4 rush linebacker. Moss was productive at both Nebraska and Youngstown and his traits could lead to continued success as an eventual NFL starter.
B.J. Singleton,NT, Good lower body strength. Able to push back against double teams and maintain some anchor. Generates some pocket push working from zero-technique and can challenge both gaps when asked to two-gap. Good toughness and is coachable., Upright and sluggish when asked to help with stunts and twists. Struggles to stack and shed consistently due to small hands. Slow to find the ball and pursue. Just a space-eater. Lacking in desired balance and body control. Needs to make more plays., UDFA, Likely camp body with good size but a lack of NFL skill against the run and pass. Needs a big week at the Shrine Game to get a team's attention and will have to prove he can compete as an NFL run-plugger to be able to have a legitimate shot to make even a practice squad.,
Ben Gedeon,ILB, Keeps pads square. Does a good job of punching blockers early and keeping himself in position to make a play. Shows ability to play off of block and keep his contain shoulder clean. Doesn't fly downhill unnecessarily. Plays with instincts in the middle. Processes well sifting through blocks and bodies to find the ball carrier. Mindful of tight ends redirecting their routes when he gets a chance. Quick to jump into the way of crossing routes to disrupt. Wants to eat on special teams. Played cover teams all four years and finished with 23 special teams tackles., Just an average athlete. Charged with 13 missed tackles this season. Lacks pursuit speed and reactive athleticism to consistently secure tackles in space. Gets engulfed at times and lacks a counter to unhinge quickly from a player's length. Initial footwork before the chase can be plodding and heavy. Doesn't have a burst gear to keep pace with NFL speed. Man coverage responsibilities could become a chore., Round 4-5,," Gedeon has ample size and talent to become an NFL backup at middle linebacker, but his bread will be buttered as a special teams performer as he has the instincts and fearlessness needed to succeed in that area. He can step in and get you through a game at inside linebacker, but his lack of speed and short area quickness could be picked at on the next level."
Billy Brown,WR, Great big receiver. Uses wide frame to create separation at top of his routes against bump-and-run coverage. Posts up cornerbacks like a basketball player. Can adjust speed of his route to accommodate the quarterback's timing. Sure-handed and can make the contested catch. Can drag cornerbacks for a long ride after the catch. Dominated his level of competition., Too tall into his routes. Press cornerbacks can get under his pads and force him off-balance inside his route. Doesn't sink into his breaks. Routes are rounded and need work. Doesn't have NFL vertical speed to get over the top of defenders. Has to create separation through physicality rather than quickness. Will be forced into consistent contested catch mode., Round 7-PFA,," The two years of production look good, but his level of competition is far from what he will see on the next level. Brown will struggle to separate as an NFL receiver and teams may consider trying him as a move tight end. His week of practice at the Shrine Game should give everyone a much clearer picture of who he is."
Calvin Munson,LB," Physical, hard-charging linebacker. Plays the game downhill and with purpose. Good motor and good aggression. Works to sink under climbing offensive linemen while playing square to the line. Willing to stand his ground and challenge lead blockers with some force. Plays with his hands. Can punch and release to play off of blocks and make tackles. Tackles with heavy pads. Very productive as a starter. Showed coverage talent on special teams early in his career.", Straight-liner with limited lateral acceleration in pursuit. Struggles to redirect his weight and is susceptible to missed tackles in space. No finesse or wiggle in his approach as a blitzer. Runs head-first into blockers rather than trying to slip past their edge. Stiff in coverage and lacks the agility for extended man coverage. Production was a little over-inflated due to amount of run blitzing he was involved in. Instincts look iffy. Will run to spots rather than locating the ball and improvising his path., PFA,," Teams will like his aggressiveness and his ability to stand his ground and bump in the box, but he lacks range as a tackler and can be mismatched in coverage."
Trey Griffey,WR," Physical receiver. Uses force to make up for a lack of quickness. Competitive after catch. Bulls through initial tackle attempts and grinds additional yardage. Catches it away from his body. Sandbags his speed early in vertical routes to set up cornerback. Sneaky long work. Once he gets cornerbacks on his hip, he doesn't let them off. Good timing to lay out and make the diving catch.", Very little noteworthy college production. Sluggish off the line of scrimmage and into routes. Lacks wiggle for quick release. Below average separation quickness. Needs to do better job of setting up in-breaking patterns. Suffers from focus drops and doesn't finish his catches. Inconsistent catching throws outside his frame. Skids into his comeback routes allowing corners time to gather and transition., PFA,," Won't get anyone's attention with his college production, but does have size and a stride length that propels him down the field as a vertical threat. The tape is raw and his route work was basic, but he competes and may have a little more upside to go if he gets additional work."
Chase Roullier,C," Thick lower body with big calves and thighs. Body is built to anchor. Well-schooled and technically sound. Dips and strikes opponent with upward blow from his hips at point of attack. Bends better than expected and unlocks his leverage potential. Gritty worker who uses body control and hand strength to sustain blocks. Generates momentum into down blocks and fork-lifts defensive tackles off their spots. Good power as drive blocker, but functional in space as well. Has starting experience at both guard and center. Plays to and after whistle. Physical and tough.", Short arms will force him to work overtime for his NFL blocks. Wasn't challenged enough by NFL-caliber power in conference. Below average snap-to-step initial movement. May lack foot quickness to handle penetrating 1-techniques as center. Can improve balance in pass protection. Has to play with better awareness and instincts against twists. Gets caught up on first twister and can be slow to pick up the looper into his gap., Round 5-6,," Lack of length will hurt his cause for some teams, but his ability to handle both guard and center duties should add to his overall draft standing. Roullier is a power-based run-blocker who plays with good leg drive and leverage to open running lanes. He could struggle to handle athletic interior linemen, but should still appeal to teams looking for a scheme flexible, power player in the later rounds."
Tobijah Hughley,C," Built low to the ground with a strong base. Shows an ability to re-set his anchor when knocked backwards. Has big, strong hands. Good upper body power. Shows an ability to latch into defender's frame and maintain his block. Looks to roll his hips under him to secure angle blocks and open a door to second level for the back.", Defaults to hands over feet when trying to work towards penetrators. Reaches with wide hands and tries to engulf rather than slide. Feet too plodding to get to play-side of a block against a heads-up defender. Beaten to the spot often. Lacks necessary recovery quickness and agility. Arms below average for pass protection duties., UDFA,," Combination of poor length and slow feet are a lethal combination for centers who hope to get drafted. While he has some anchor power and upper body strength, his inability to work outside of a phone booth limits his NFL potential."
Derek Rivers,DE," Consistent, high-level production as a starter. Plays the same way from snap to snap and plays with high football character. Strikes with quick upward punch under tackle's shoulders to stake a leverage claim on the edge. Good burst out of stance as pass rusher. Rushes with lean and dips low to propel himself around the edge at his fourth step. Creates speed-to-power push with a second gear into contract. Works to uncover outside shoulder and spill play-side runs to the boundary. Adequate power for stand-up linebacker on next level. Flashes disruptive qualities in gaps. Adequate pursuit speed.", Needs to play with better gap awareness after setting edge. Plays with head down after contact and loses sight of the running backs. Slow to disengage and make plays on running backs darting into the B-gap. Has problems when matched up against length. Long arms can grind his pass rush into neutral and engulf him in run game. Will need to improve at the point of attack to play on the next level. Tight-hipped in his rush. Lacks fluidity to string moves together., Round 2-3,," Motor-based edge rusher with some tightness in his hips who used efficient hands and consistent effort to whip the competition in front of him. Rivers may lack the length and agility to be a consistent, stand-up rusher on the next level, but he has the talent to find a spot as a backup who could work his way into a more prominent role with time."
Taylor McNamara,TE," Flashes separation speed on shallow crossers and drags underneath. Made outstanding one-handed catch against Alabama and shows an ability to sink and dig out the low throw. Can make contested catches over the middle. Adjusts routes to avoid redirection. Undersized, but utilizes desired footwork and technique as a blocker. Shows some sustain with strong hands against outside linebackers.", Doesn't have enough wiggle in the open field to create much more than what he catches if traffic is near. Needs to look for throws a little more quickly. Wasn't asked to do much from route standpoint. Too small to make a living along line of scrimmage. Can be overwhelmed by size., PFA,," Move tight end with limited pass catching production and a need for more bulk as a blocker. With decent athleticism and a willingness to work at his blocking, McNamara has a chance to make it into camp and catch a team's eye if he can stand out on special teams."
Storm Norton,OT," Tall tackle with extremely long legs and arms are well above average for the position at over 35 inches long. Adequate foot quickness in his pass slides. Blocks with good arm extension and utilizes length as a recovery tool when beaten. Better lateral movement than expected. Able to pull and lead block in power. Combo blocks feature strong secure and fluid climb to second level target. Needs more knee bend, but lands at a high rate in space. Mirrors in pass sets with good balance and good posture.", Plays from a two-point stance in Toledo offense. Will have to learn to play from three-point stance and fire out of his stance with better bend. Steps are slow and stiff into his first contact. Hands are strong but placement is too wide. Opponents will land first and jolt him due to natural leverage deficiency because of his height. High-cut frame creates anchor imbalance. Below average redirect against inside counters., Round 7-PFA, Pace Murphy," Towering tackle who operates with adequate body control and balance in both run and pass blocking. Norton gets the most out of his length, but also has the same leverage and anchor issues that almost all tall tackles have. He hasn't faced premier pass rushers or power ends in his conference so projecting him on the next level could be a challenge. If he has enough anchor, he could make an NFL roster."
Eric Keena,P," Has improved kickoff depth and touchback percentage in each of the last two seasons. Used rugby-style punting but showed ability to bang it as base punter as well. Despite the skewed statistics due to punting style, may have the ability to boom it out of his own end zone. Two-step approach to punt. Saw just 4 percent of his career punts end in touchbacks.", Thin punter who could have issues finishing necessary tackles in open field. Hang time below average on kickoffs and punts. Allowed two punt return touchdowns and one kickoff return touchdown this season. Doesn't get great leg extension on his punts. Snap-to-punt time of 2.18 is a little slow., UDFA,," He will have to prove to teams in the post-season practices and workouts that he can be a consistent base punter who can hit it with power, quickness and accuracy. His experience handling kickoffs could help his cause."
Evan Goodman,OG, Has NFL size. Sports wide hips and a big rear. Plays with balance and body control and makes defenders work around him. Has long arms with big hands. Shows ability to process quickly and adjust assignments on time. Has enough feet to punch and mirror through the rep. Good athlete for a big man. Fluid feet in his skip pull. Can redirect his weight and plays with sturdy post leg. Not much wasted motion as a blocker. Plays with adequate arm extension and recovery ability., Has played in passive sets as tackle and will have to learn to fire off ball as a guard. Will get caught lunging forward and leaving himself open to an inside move against run. Carries hands a little low and wide. Will need to operate with quicker hands on the interior. Hands will land outside the shoulder. Runs up teammates hip on double teams and doesn't execute the block consistently. Too tall on down blocks and base blocks and fails to generate desired push at point of attack., PFA,," His wide frame doesn't possess the drive blocker power expected for his size, but he's athletic and he plays with decent body control and balance. Goodman's physical attributes will be appealing, but his game is more reactive than aggressive and that may be difficult to change."
Gabe Marks,WR, Gets into routes with good forward lean and decent acceleration. Creates movement in defenders with his routes and leverages himself into open throwing windows. Shows very good body control when ball is in the air. Works aggressively back to the throw and scrambles with his quarterback to open up. Natural hands catch most everything. Plucks it with good extension. Excellent footwork near the boundary. Has short-area foot quickness to create separation as well as elude tacklers in tight quarters. Has some suddenness in and out of his breaks., Can be physically dominated by size. At times will struggle to find a quality release against press. Lacks route strength and can be too easily re-routed. Below average vertical push into his routes and top speed is non-threatening. Production totals bolstered by volume of targets and short passing game. Loses some focus when ball leads him into traffic. Plays finesse football and plays small. Needs to get better at stacking cornerbacks once he gets the jump on them. Has unusual ball security issues after the catch., Round 7-PFA,," Possession receiver with below average speed, but adequate quickness and separation ability underneath. Marks has worked outside and from the slot and he blocks enough to be considered by teams who like to run out of three-wideout sets. Marks' best fit might be in the slot and his draft slotting will be heavily influenced by his 40 time."
Scott Orndoff,TE," Experience working down the field in Pitt's pro-style passing attack. Works the seam and secures the catch despite imminent punishment from safety. Banger after the catch. Reliable in-line blocker. Secures and climbs smoothly in combo blocks. Adjusts blocking assignments quickly when initial block vacates. Has potential to handle himself on an island in pass protection from time to time. Can become a solid blocking ""Y"" tight end for a run-heavy team.", Tight in his routes. Needs to do better job of setting up his breaks rather than rolling straight into them. Slow to cut and open to the throw. Needs scheme to uncover him rather than route quickness. Stiff upper body limits catch radius beyond first level. Drop rate of 10.4 percent this year is too high. Needs to take better angles to second level targets. Needs to remember to run his feet under his hands for longer block sustain., Round 6-7, Logan Paulsen," Blocking tight end whose yards per catch numbers do not represent his vertical ability. Orndoff will struggle to get open, but can make contested catches and function as a play-action threat near the end zone. He does have the size and desire to become an NFL blocker who might improve a rushing attack that is soft on the edge."
Rodney Adams,WR, Plays fast. Keeps a crisp pace in his routes and and is able to glide past defenders who underestimate him. Shifty to avoid would-be jams and route redirection. Can adjust to throws behind him. Quick to drop feet after catch near sideline. Competitive runner after the catch with a surprising burst. Shows some lateral escapability and a nasty spin move. Keeps feet moving through tackle attempts and is slippery to bring down. Averaged just over 25 yards per kick return while at South Florida., Thin frame with skinny legs. Play strength could be a big concern. Will be challenged to secure passes through contact on the next level. Has small hands and issues with ball security. Drop rate was sky high over sophomore and junior season. Fumbled five times this season on just 90 touches. Production bolstered by wide receiver screens and pop passes. Too thin to hold up as a legitimate blocker in running game., Rounds 5-6, Tavarres King," Tall, thin slot wide receiver with an ability to work both short and deep. Adams wasn't asked to win with his routes and will have to improve in that area. His competitive nature and urgency jumps off the tape when the ball is in his hands, but his drops and fumbles are troubling. Has the traits to make a roster as a kick returner and fourth/fifth wide receiver early on."
Nick Weiler,K," Good athlete. Shows ability to range across field in kick coverage and willing to tackle when needed. Directional kicker who can place it outside the hash. Good elevation on field goals. Was 7-of-9 beyond 40 yards and made a 54-yard game-winner to beat Florida State at the gun. As a sophomore, all three of his onside kick attempts were recovered by his kicking team.", Over-commits at times on kickoff coverage. Loses his leverage and will open middle of the field up for kick returners. Had two kicks blocked this season. Missed three times from 30-39. Kickoffs hang-time is below desired norm., FA,," Weiler has enough leg to be an NFL kicker and more times than not he strikes the ball cleanly and with good elevation. While his confidence has been an issue in the past, it is currently on an uptick. His kickoff distance and hang-time need to improve, but he has a shot at finding himself in an NFL camp with an outside shot at making a roster."
Michael Roberts,TE," When he catches the ball, it matters. Has had over 80 percent of his career catches go for first downs and this season saw 35.5 percent of his catches go for touchdowns (16). Big target with gigantic hands. Quick to open and find the ball on stop routes. Plus body control to adjust and clamp down on throws outside his frame. Will continue to probe and adjust for openings against zone coverage. Very capable run blocker. Operates from strong base and utilizes lengths well. Sinks hips to brace up and neutralize defensive ends with leverage and uses hips and shoulder turn to steer out of the play. Has experience blocking from in-line and from wing spot.", Comes out of a knock-kneed stance from line of scrimmage. Upright short strider into routes. Gradual gear down into his breaks. Tight at the top of his route. Rolls through his cuts to create momentum for his separation. Angles up to linebackers as blocker will need work. Overshoots targets and allows them to make plays underneath his block. Needs blocks to be right in front of him. Too many misses in space., Round 5-6,," One season of ""wow"" production, but has NFL size and length. Roberts' tape shows inconsistent effort from a blocking standpoint, but it also shows the strength and ability to handle those chores on the next level. He should be a functional receiver target as well and could come in as a third tight end with the ability to work his way up the ladder."
Lucas Crowley,C, Under control into his approach as a run blocker. Generates momentum with rhythmic skip steps and slams into his down blocks with some force. Always looking to run his feet through contact for maximum block security. Light on his feet with desired lateral bounce for zone scheme. Decent athlete in space. Can lead the charge as pull blocker and adjust to moving targets. Measured climb to second level linebackers and leverages them out of the gap with proper angles. Looks for work in pass protection. Smart and durable.," May be too small for the NFL. Needs to add about 15 more pounds, but not sure he has the frame to carry it. Has to keep defenders in his power zone or he can slide off. Strength as a blocker diminishes greatly once a player gets to his edge. Forced to lean on bigger defensive tackles trying to maintain his position. Can be pulled off-balance by aggressive hand work. Struggled against Florida State when he was covered by a nose. Gives ground against bull rushers.", PFA,," Undersized center-only prospect who does admirable work when uncovered and working on angles. Crowley has adequate hand strength for sustained block engagement, good body control and plays a technical game; however, his lack of size and length could make him a priority free agent."
Kevin Davis,LB, Makes plays near the line of scrimmage. Landed 24.5 tackles for loss over last two seasons. Athletic and smooth in his movements. Steps downhill with good balance and gathers himself in a tackle-ready position. Can flow and mirror a running back's change of direction. Able to extend his frame laterally and make the diving stop against shifty running backs. Can chase in space. Has consecutive 100-plus tackle seasons as a starter. Good hip fluidity in his drops and has some man-cover potential. Disguises blitzes and has speed to burst by unsuspecting offensive linemen., Offers zero power as a tackler. Allows runners to deliver as much or more of a blow at the point of contact. Needs better bend and hip explosion into tackles. Too passive as a take-on linebacker. Will turn his head and lead with right shoulder no matter his location in the gap. Turns head into contact and loses sight of runner. Needs to get much better with his hands at the point of attack and as a blitzer. Loses too often to first block and struggles to play off of them quickly. Instincts are below average and plays through a straw with his vision., PFA,," Productive, two-year starter with solid athleticism to finish as a tackler, but a lack of functional strength and interior grit. Davis needs to get better at creating his own opportunities with aggression and urgency if he is to make an NFL roster. He will likely have to move outside as he lacks the anchor and physicality for the interior."
Kenny Golladay,WR," Tall with arm length to match. Has room to add more muscle and strength. Was the quarterback's pet with his long, available frame. Steps into his routes with push and purpose. Long-strider who, if unaccosted, can eat up cushion and work over top of cornerbacks. Good hand fighter who can create additional vertical separation. Catches it away from his body and with desired extension. Long arms offer a wide net for a catch radius. Can go way up or dig out the low ball. Shows good instincts in space and will work back to the ball if he senses the window closing down."," Route strength is below average. Can be knocked off course and off schedule in timing routes. Has build-up speed but needs a clean runway. Could struggle to uncover against bump-and-run corners. Below average sideline awareness. Made too many catches against the sideline that didn't end up counting. Needs to leverage more throwing room for his quarterbacks on vertical boundary throws. Route work failed to create tilt from defenders. Routes need to be better disquised. Passive, positional run blocker who waits to block until he has to.", Round 4-5, Jordan Taylor," He will be a height, weight, speed prospect headed into the combine, but will need to prove he can run to solidify his draft standing. Golladay could be targeted by teams looking for a field-stretcher with size who has the potential to become a matchup problem in the redzone. Golladay has the talent to become an eventual starter in the league."
Justin Senior,OT, Gains adequate ground in his slides. Keeps chin tucked and helmet out of his pass sets. Hitch-free punch is generally well-timed. Inside hand is stiff. Throws strikes with strong hands that glue to the frame. Adequate mirror after engagement. Able to reset hands and keep defenders at the end of his long arms. Body control is adequate. Smart angles to his blocks and can have an impact on second level. Works feet into lateral position before engaging. Drive power comes from inner foot. Intelligent with good field awareness., Footwork is inconsistent. Needs more bulk and more muscle in his upper body. Movement lacks desired flexibility. Weight distribution in a consistent issue. Gets weight too far outside in his pass sets opening an inside lane. Too willing to chase speed with a gallop around the edge rather than maintaining technique. Struggles to drop pad level and can be rocked onto one foot as wall-off blocker. Has anchor problems against good speed-to-power. Stiff-legged with limited effectiveness when asked to pull., Rounds 6-7,," Senior has long arms and strong hands, but his lack of bend and inconsistent footwork could cripple his NFL cause if he doesn't improve them. Senior is a right tackle only who has three years of experience against talented, SEC defensive ends but he struggled badly at times in the Senior Bowl. His size could get him drafted, but he has some work to do before ever hitting an NFL field."
Gunner Kiel,QB, Looks like an NFL quarterback with broad shoulders and a well-proportioned build. Able to get the ball out quickly when he sees a receiver break open suddenly. Throws with adequate timing and his confidence grows when he finds his rhythm. Has NFL arm strength. Can work through progressions. Adequate pocket mobility to elude pressure. Throws with adequate touch on deep shots., Has suffered from a number of injuries that have hindered his career. Career has regressed badly since his sophomore season. Inaccurate passer. Struggled badly on intermediate throws. Loses confidence and sprays the ball around. Needs to lead receivers with deep balls. Makes too many poor decisions too often. Stares down slot receivers and can be an easy read for linebackers. Feet are heavy in his setup and footwork is inconsistent in delivery. Inconsistent delivery balance., UDFA,," Heralded five-star prospect out of high school with NFL size and an NFL arm, Kiel lacks the consistency, accuracy and mental makeup expected from NFL quarterbacks. His traits are worthy of consideration, but the tape is likely way too uneven to warrant a draft pick. If Kiel can't stay healthy, he won't last long in a camp."
Harvey Langi,DE, Athletic with moldable traits. Former running back who has been bounced around on defensive side and should be able to unlock his athletic ability once he gets set at inside linebacker. Has enough upper body strength and footwork to play off blocks and work towards the ball. Good close-out burst to the sideline. Able to stay square to line of scrimmage for extended lateral slide thanks to twitch and power in feet. Has man cover potential in passing game. Aggressive working downhill with speed to shoot gaps.," Lacking necessary instincts for the position. Thinks rather than reacts. Is slow to find the football and has issues with misdirection. Maturity has been an issue in the past. Way behind with his fundamentals for position. Showed improvement with feet and hands this year but they still need work. Has to fire a strong punch earlier in rep to keep himself clean. Play base gets narrow at times and his contact balance is inconsistent. Needs to do better job of playing disciplined, gap-sound football.", Round 4-5, Mark Nzeocha," Athletic, traits-based prospect who is behind with his fundamentals and instincts, but is still in the process of learning his position. Langi looks undraftable based on this season's tape, but he played out of position for much of the season and could find more success once he can stay inside. A solid Shrine Game week and a good combine could land him on Day 3 of the draft and propel him into an NFL backup role."
Josh Augusta,DT, Enormous mountain of a man. Extra wide with the mass to cause problems on single blocks. Able to generate decent push off the snap. Has above average feet for a man his size., Doesn't have enough functional quickness to make plays unless they are right at him. Locks up with player in front of him rather than searching for the ball. Pad level too high to be an anchor-dropper against double teams. Non-factor as a rusher., UDFA,," Has the size that makes him intriguing, but he plays too top-heavy and is unable to effectively own his space and fight off down blocks. Augusta needs to lose weight and try to improve his quickness which could bolster his run support potential."
Jordan Westerkamp,WR, Hands showed great improvement this season. Hand-eye coordination is above average and is able to hyperfocus when catching in tight quarters. Gets the most out of his catch radius. Able to go up or down and reel in the challenging catch. Finds ways to create a little bit of space for himself through his routes. Some might say he runs them precisely. Uses every inch of his frame to shield defenders from the ball. Shows no hesitation in the middle of the field., Slow release quickness into routes. Lacks the long speed and physical ability to play anywhere but slot. Short strider into his routes. Lacks vertical speed to threaten defenders and back them off. Sluggish to accelerate out of breaks. Wears defenders as blankets within his routes and is always forced to make contested catches. Body catcher., PFA,," Possession receiver with good focus and a determination to come up with the contested catch. Lacks traits like speed and length and he doesn't have separation quickness, but he finds ways to create enough room for an accurate quarterback. His lack of legitimate return value could hurt his cause to make a team."
Jason Carr,DT, Has desired NFL size with arms that reach beyond 34 inches. Lower body has even more room for weight and muscle and he might be able to add substantially more weight to his already large frame. Bends knees and plays under opponents pads as long as he can at point of attack. Has good anchor and can fight back against double teams., Slow twitch with very little explosive qualities. Gets hung up on blocks longer than an Internet Explorer browser trying to close. Allows guards to grab and hold him rather than ripping their hands off his body. Marginal pursuit speed and play-making radius. Below-average agility and doesn't threaten the gaps with his get-off. Unable to generate pass rush against lower level of competition., PFA,," Will likely get invited to a camp on his size and length alone. Carr is a long way from being an NFL prospect, but teams could see him as a developmental project that can pack on the pounds and potentially plug-in as a space-eating defensive tackle down the road."
Malik Hooker,S," Outstanding instincts help him work ahead of the play despite average speed. Always probing quarterback's eyes for clues. Quick to process and is decisive in action. Flows hard to where his instincts lead him. Has fluid movement of a basketball player in space. Leans and bends into his turns for greater body control. Always active and in constant on-field search for optimal positioning. Hyper-aware of incoming targets to his area. Just as comfortable from ""robber"" spot as high safety. Mirrors quarterbacks eyes to challenge the passing lane. Very rarely takes a false step. Has loose hips for sudden stop-start to cover in space. Great ball skills. Earned most of his seven interceptions in 2016. Can range over the top to challenge the deep ball. Chooses path to the football over path to the man. Strong hands at the catch point lead to takeaways. Can disguise coverage and hustle back into position. Will strike receivers with some force to jar throws loose.", Just one year of experience. Raw and still learning nuances of the position. More instinctive against the pass than run. At times can be a step slow to trigger downhill to take on the run. Will take some questionable downhill angles to the ball. Not overly physical against the run. Will duck head and go way low as a tackler. Below-average finisher. Comes in hot rather than coming to balance as a striker. Arm-tackler who needs to tighten up his mechanics. Missed 17 tackles this season. Balance issues show up on tape. Still growing into his leggy frame. Will get caught guessing rather than reading. Squats on tight ends and slot receivers from man and gets grabby at the top of the route., Round 1, Reggie Nelson," He's the ultimate lurker. His instincts are always bringing him to the football and when he gets there he has the ball skills to take it away. His lack of game experience and issues with tackle consistency will likely show themselves early in his career, but his ability to flip the field is worthy of an aggressive projection. He has the talent to be a high-impact starter for years in the NFL."
Marshon Lattimore,CB," Uber-athlete. Parks under receiver's chin at line of scrimmage. Uses disruptive inside hand to slow the release and can punch out of his pedal.

Has twitch to drive hard toward the throw from his lateral shuffle. Plays with plus instincts. Targeted 35 times this season and credited with 14 passes defensed, including four interceptions. Has burst and instincts to make plays from any coverage asked of him. Forceful open-field tackler. Works through blockers to get to both wide receiver screens and running plays. Wrap-up hitter who sees what he hits.", Only one year of starting experience. Wasn't tested by high-end receiving talent very often. Will be much tougher to consistently slow NFL receivers with jam and might have to learn to play some off coverage. Showed slight transition hitch when matched up against in inside release. Will read receiver's eyes to assess ball-timing down the field rather than getting his head around early. Film shows infrequent issues recovering against speed merchants., Round 1, Vontae Davis," Average-sized, one-year starter with explosive athleticism and a loaded tool box. He has the feet, hips and agility to be a lockdown cornerback and the ball skills to make teams pay for looking in his direction. His lack of experience could show up early, but he has the confidence and competitive nature that should help him overcome those issues. He has the ability to become a Pro Bowl cornerback early in his career."
Gareon Conley,CB," Has NFL size with above-average length. Plays long. At his best when playing with inside leverage and trapping receivers against the boundary. Shades receivers with a basketball stance -- wide base, bent knees and wide arms. Creates challenging throwing lanes to target. Allowed just 37 percent completion rate. Press-man talent with zone instincts. Shows discipline and technique on verticals and curls. Matches with his feet rather than grabbing. Senses when his pattern is designed to clear space for another receiver and reacts accordingly. Has plus burst to the throw. Uses length to play around receiver and bat passes down underneath without interfering. Runs well and sinks into receiver's lap down the field, getting his head around to make a play on the ball. Plays the ball with soft hands and outstanding timing.", Can be a little tight-hipped in his transitions. Pattern-match was just average when facing off against more advanced route trees. Michigan receivers created separation and some panic in Conley with their inside releases and crossing routes. Got caught reaching and holding in attempt to recover. Will occasionally default to face-guarding rather than turning to find ball. Can be slow to digest route combinations and lose track of his man. Doesnt look as comfortable or confident in off-man. Plays small in run support and needs to work on consistency as a tackler. Gets driven off his spot by blocking receivers and rarely charges forward to attack near the line of scrimmage., Round 1, Aqib Talib," Press-corner with experience at both cornerback spots and an ability to fit into a variety of coverage techniques. He plays with good top-end speed and has the ball skills to challenge and defend passes on any level. He can step in right away in zone coverage, but could struggle to match patterns from a pedal. He will likely be targeted by teams seeking long cornerbacks who can crowd and trail receivers down the field. He has the talent to become an early starter, but he must improve in run support."
Deshaun Watson,QB," Tremendous leader and winner. Good pocket posture with quiet upper body. Good pocket mobility and doesn't show much panic when pocket gets noisy. Sacked just 32 times over his last 1,181 drop-backs. Willing to stand in and deliver the ball against rib-wreckers on a clear path for him. Has history of clutch play in big games and big moments. Averaged 472 yards of total offense with eight total touchdowns and one interception in his two  championship appearances against Alabama. Throws with anticipation and touch.

Keeps ball tucked near his chest when scanning. Has compact, over-the-top release that uncorks a tight, pretty spiral. Throws with adequate accuracy on the move. Has traits to operate out of boot-action attack. Tremendous athlete who has ability to pick up chunks of yardage on ground. Has called running plays could ignite a stagnant offense. Has instant juice out of pocket to make defense pay if rush lanes are vacated. Does a good job of sliding or eluding square collisions in space as a runner. Dual-threat weapon near end zone who will create additional preparation time for coaching staffs looking to limit his effectiveness in the red area. Every meaningful passing stat improved in close-and-late situations in 2016."," Frame is a little more slender than teams typically like. Accuracy runs hot and cold. Tends to over-stride on drive throws, causing release point to drop and balls to sail. Ball placement on crossing routes and slants needs to improve. Will leave throws behind intended targets. Deep-ball accuracy has been scatter-shot over his last two seasons at Clemson, with throws sailing well beyond his target. Design of offense limited his need to make full-field reads. Has to become adept at working through progressions and playing chess against safeties. Needs to let routes develop rather than rushing anticipatory throws. Too many interceptions due to lack of vision, placement or decision-making. Threw interception vs. Troy against bracketed coverage he didn't see. Baited into bad-decision interceptions twice by Florida State cornerbacks. Has issues improvising away from initial, pre-snap plan even when pathway to target becomes muddy. Shotgun quarterback who, like Jared Goff, could take time getting used to huddling, pace of play-calling and drop-backs from under center.", Rounda 1-2, Marcus Mariota," Teams will have to weigh the inconsistent field vision and decision-making against his size, athleticism, leadership and production. While not perfect, teams can add checks to both arm and accuracy boxes for Watson. However, discussions about whether or not his areas of improvement can be corrected will likely determine whether a team will view him as a high-upside prospect or a franchise quarterback. Watson's transition from Clemson's offense to a pro-style attack will obviously take time, but his combination of intangibles and athletic ability make him worth a first-round selection."
T.J. Watt,OLB," Produced at high-end level with just one season of full-time football. Has desired length for the edge with room to accommodate more size. Attacks blockers with early arm extension and utilizes push-pull technique to upset their balance as his pet move against run and pass. Outstanding hand play in his game.

Rarely has helmet involved in play and is constantly searching for the ball. Understands art of quick disengagements and can flatten out against outside run. Has good agility to clear trash near his feet and pursue the ball. Functional in space when asked to cover. Can get skinny when shooting gaps and has decisiveness and pursuit quickness to crash down the line and close-out cutback lanes. Consistent, wrap-up finisher as tackler.", Not overly twitched-up as an athlete. Short strider who lacks explosion out of stance and up the field to bend the edge as a pass rusher. Foot quickness is average and needs to win with technique and great hand play. Won't generate enough acceleration to crank up speed-to-power rush with consistency. Plays with a narrow base. Needs to play with more consistent bend to play through redirection by offensive line. Will have to add power in his base to hold point of attack against tackles. Pass rush menu will need more options against NFL tackles., Round 2, Paul Kruger," A long-limbed effort rusher who posted impressive numbers against the run and pass in just one year as a starter. He is a tireless worker who pursues from snap to whistle and his brother, J.J., will be a tremendous resource for technique and pass-rush plan. While he is unlikely to win a race to the edge, he's a plus run defender who can get to the quarterback with plus hand work and relentless effort."
Adoree' Jackson,CB," Feel in coverage has improved substantially from his freshman season. Shows greater pattern recognition and is able to maintain coverage around the field. Has necessary hip flip and foot quickness to recover from mistakes in press and lapses in coverage in space. Plays in a variety of coverage techniques. Able to mirror and match from press. Features closing burst and takes playmaking angles to the throw. Excellent ball skills with well-timed leaps and aggressive tactics at the catch point. Good feel for when to defend a throw and when to take it away. Consistent tackler. When he gets there, he usually finishes his task. High-end return talent who can swing games in an instant. His eight career return touchdowns make him an immediate return man for any team that takes him.", Smallish for an outside cornerback. Might be limited to just work in the slot. Can be a little over-aggressive with pace of bail coverage when fearing speed. Has a very slight hitch in transition forward from his pedal. Allowed routes to leverage him too far out of the middle of the field when he had no safety help. Could have issues with big slots posting him up in space. Lack of size and run-support strength could make him an early target for teams who like to run out of 11 personnel (three wide receivers)., Round 1-2, Johnathan Joseph," There are two things teams love -- ball production from cornerbacks and return men who can play meaningful snaps on every down. Jackson fits those criteria. His lack of size and length are concerns, but he has the athleticism to step right in as a slot corner on the next level. His combination of coverage and return talent could make him an early impact player."
Curtis Samuel,WR," Has crisp feet for sudden change of direction. Long-strider with deep speed to challenge press coverage over the top. Shows defender an exaggerated jab fake at top of his routes to generate lean from cornerback and create separation out of his break. On comeback routes, can stutter feet into his break for a sudden stop-and-open timing throws. Has explosiveness both vertically and out of his breaks to uncover on all three levels. Can ramp it back up to top gear quickly after tapping his brakes in space. At his best when matched up in open space. Gets faster and more dangerous as the play unfolds. Has two years of kick-return experience. Moveable matchup piece."," Plays with some hip tightness that make his play more linear than fluid. Needs to work on release against press. Could get hung up off the line and into his routes by athletic, press-cover slot men. Has unnatural hands that fight the throw. Will default to body catches. Didn't have as many ""pro-style"" touches as teams would like. Averaged just 5.5 yards at the catch point, and several carries came on jet sweeps and stretch plays from shotgun. Average ball-tracking and adjustments to poor throws. Wasn't asked to handle blocking responsibilities very often.", Round 2, Josh Huff," Jack-of-all trades but master of none, Samuel showed an ability to gain yardage and create scoring opportunities in a variety of ways on a talented Buckeyes offense. However, NFL teams will want to slot him into a more defined role, which is most likely at receiver. He is still learning the position and has separation quickness to create open throwing lanes, but while he's sharpening his route work, he could find early reps as a kick returner."
Marlon Humphrey,CB, Has the body type and athletic traits that are out of central casting. Fluid hips and hard-charging makeup speed. Well-versed in a variety of coverages. Plays with disciplined eyes and good balance between high-low responsibilities in zone. Good short-area acceleration to close out receivers and attack throwing lanes. Reactive athleticism helps erase coverage mistakes. Extremely competitive with an edge that spikes after he's beaten. Timid receivers should take the day off. Aggressive from press with a powerful punch. Looks to intimidate when the opportunity arises. Drives receivers out of bounds and out of the play if their vertical release takes them too close to the boundary. Will not let a blocking receiver punk him. Tears through blocker and attacks downhill. Searches for opportunities to strip the ball; forced three fumbles in 2016.," Impatient from press coverage. Opens inside or outside too early rather than waiting for a clear declare from receiver. Struggles to stay in phase throughout the route and allows separation opportunities. Feet are fast but sloppy. Footwork becomes bulky and balance diminishes when matched against quality route workers. Plays a scrambling style of coverage that is too reliant upon his athletic gifts. Issues playing the deep ball are a concern. From off coverage, overreacts to route fakes and opens the door to a big play. Allowed more than 19 yards per completion as a starter. Can be slow to locate the ball and finds himself out of optimal position to play the ball.", Round 1, Jimmy Smith," Talented height-weight-speed prospect who comes from NFL bloodlines. Might need time for his technique to catch up with his traits. Coverage inconsistencies could cause him to struggle against quality competition early on, but his mental makeup and recovery talent should help him pull through. Has the instincts and run-support skills to become an early starter for a zone-cover defense, but it will be hard for teams looking for a lockdown, man corner to pass on all of those physical gifts early in the draft."
Marcus Williams,S, Athletic and instinctive from high safety. Easy hips with smooth feet in his backpedal. Able to play from deep positioning and still make plays on the ball. Good recognition of quarterbacks intentions gives him  a head-start on the throw. Has desired open-field speed to close from hash to sideline. Former basketball player and high-jumper with the leaping ability and timing to win the 50-50 throws. Posted 10 interceptions against 44 targets over last two seasons. Productive tackler and careful finisher. Steps downhill against the run. Leverages ball carriers to the sideline and rarely lets him cross back over into middle of the field. Gathers feet and widens out to unfurl a wider tackling net., Needs to add some muscle on his slim frame. More of a finesses safety than hitter. Takes the worst of it in one-on-one tackles. Can be dragged along for additional yardage. Plays with a hitch in his transition from backpedal. Occasionally follows quarterback's eyes too carefully and can be manipulated., Rounds 2-3, Justin Simmons," Ball-hawking free safety who has outstanding ball skills and has shown a propensity for causing turnovers. He can play from a high centerfield spot and utilizes his instincts to swoop down and challenge throws. He's able to get running backs down, but hes not physical enough to be a combination safety. NFL teams love defensive backs with athletic traits, instincts and ball skills. If he works out well before the draft, he should move up team boards."
Chad Hansen,WR," Maneuvers around route redirection in space and keeps his route on time. Works back to the throw. Has some talent after catch on wide receiver screens. Drive off the line and into his routes is consistent no matter which level he is going to work. Good awareness near sidelines. Able to drop his feet in-bounds when crowded against the boundary. Plays with good strength and physicality when mugged in his routes. Has fluid, powerful strides to burst past cornerbacks on vertical routes. Natural ball-tracker. Plus body control for ball adjustments in any direction. Hands are strong and can secure in traffic. Didnt have to run much of the route tree, but showed willingness to work the middle.

Able to make first tackler miss and accelerate into open field.", Upright off the snap and into his routes. Is eventual into breaks and allows cornerback time to gear down and transition back to the ball. Can be jammed up by strong press corners. Doesnt create enough consistent separation with his intermediate routes. Route work at Cal was basic. Will face his share of contested catches on the pro level. Allows throws to crowd his frame. Needs to get better at using body to shield throws from defenders., Round 3, Allen Hurns," Hansen has good combination of size and speed for the perimeter with an ability to climb over the top of cornerbacks and win the deep ball. He has average separation quickness when asked to work the first two levels, but he has the hands and strength to handle contested catch situations. An ascending prospect in draft circles who should hear his name called on Day 2 (Rounds 2-3) of the daft with a chance to become a WR2."
Raekwon McMillan,LB, Downhill movement after the snap is his norm. Understands angles. Can outpace pulling guards to the spot with his play quickness. Reads his keys and responds. Plays with good anticipation of lane choice by the runner. Attacks hands-first into blockers with good arm extension to keep his frame clean. Good zone-cover ability. Reads quarterback's eyes and slides into passing lanes. Has added additional thickness during his tenure.," Struggles to leverage his gap as a take-on linebacker. Gets widened out of his gap by size. Gets trapped on the wrong side of the block. Tends to play over the top of a block rather than under it. Slow to disengage and tackle. Tight in his lower half. Missing the quick, reactive change of direction to consistently secure shifty runners. Delayed in stop-start pursuit to the sideline. Has some limitations in man coverage.", Round 3, Mason Foster," McMillan has too many issues standing his ground and leveraging his gap as an interior run defender and could end up outside in the pros. He might have benefited from playing alongside a slew of NFL talent, but he's active and plays the game with good instincts. He has the potential to become an average starter in the league."
Isaiah Ford,WR, Superb athlete with good height. Able to shake press coverage with quick jab step and sudden burst. Feet look spring-loaded underneath. Features big acceleration out of his breaks and is able to create easy throwing windows on slants and crossing routes. Varies route speed to disguise his intentions. Chomps up cushion with his speed and stems defenders into off-balance transitions and false steps. Sustains vertical danger throughout his routes. Can get up and over cornerbacks without appearance of much effort. Tracks the deep ball and has ball skills to finish. Works back to underthrown passes and is able to contort in mid-air to make the catch.," Thin frame needs weight for greater functional strength. Can be redirected off route by force. Will sit and wait too long on throws. Needs to shield throws from defender. Can be late adjusting to off-target throws. Average hand strength as pass catcher. Has speed, but lacks elusiveness after the catch. Lacks instincts for the position. Gets open with speed and quickness rather than being route-savvy. Physicality and athleticism of NFL cornerbacks will take adjustment time. Positional run blocker who can be thrown out of the way by aggressive cornerbacks.", Round 4-5, Justin Hunter," Tall but thin, Ford uses his suddenness to uncover on all three levels and his speed to climb over the top and stress defenses vertically. His play strength is concerning as NFL cornerbacks will consistently challenge him off the line of scrimmage. He also has to prove he can be effective when facing zone coverage. He has the height and speed to be a deep-ball menace in the right scheme, but he has a little lower floor than some Day 2 receiver prospects in this draft."
Alek Torgersen,QB," Three-year starter with fit build and NFL size. Athletic with success in zone-read. Dug into the film after sophomore season with desire to become smarter quarterback and showed drastic reduction of interceptions over next two years. Keeps ball tucked high and tight pre-delivery. Has big, strong hands to pump and reload if he spies late trouble. Ball comes out of his hand with tight spiral and good velocity. Gets it out quick if pressure flashes suddenly. Throws with touch on deep balls. Naturally accurate and throws with confidence between the hashes."," Lacks experience in pro-style attack. Checks are called from the sideline. Offense filled with one-and-done reads. Has to break habit of staring targets down. Wasn't asked to be a full-field reader. Will have to play faster to adjust to shrinking NFL throwing windows. Will hang onto the ball a tick too long on rollouts. Inconsistent release. At times, his release with become elongated and with a pronounced dip in it. Reads could be inconsistent against zone.", Round 7-PFA, Zac Dysert," Developmental quarterback with NFL size and a good head on his shoulders. Torgersen's success came against a much lower level of competition, but it is worth noting that his accuracy and arm strength will also benefit his growth when he's throwing to NFL-caliber targets. Torgersen's traits make him a late round stash-and-hide prospect with practice squad potential early, but he could see his draft stock rise if he has a big offseason."
Andrew King,LB, Plays with a consistent motor. Always active throughout the snap and will keep pursuing down the field to make the tackle. Squeezes down tight on the backside to fit into the cutback lane. Able to sift through moving bodies and maintain eyes on the ball. Doesn't rush downhill without a plan.

Doesn't play with his hands often enough at point of attack. Needs to flow square in tackle-ready position., UDFA,," Good thickness for the interior and plays with desire and effort, but lacks the athleticism and range necessary for the position as an NFL contributor."
Cameron Tom,C," Full-time, three-year starter. Has good lower body thickness. Patient blocker up to the second level. Climbs with a wide base trying maximize his ability to get a piece of darting linebackers. Takes quality angles to his blocks. Tries to sink and get as much bend and torque into his initial contact. Strikes with upward punch and is able to extends arms for more control. Able to withstand bull rush attempts and anchor down in pass pro.", Straight-legged with narrow base into angle blocks. Inconsistent working feet and hips into position to secure his move blocks. Plays with below average balance in space and through contact. Needs to add more mass and improve his core strength. Slow to adjust assignments when needed. Snap to step quickness is off. Poor reactions and awareness at times against twists., UDFA,," Tom looks bigger than his listed weight, so it will be interesting to see where he measures at the Shrine Game and combine. Tom has good arm length and decent anchor, but he's a very average run blocker who will need more technique work to lock in a roster spot."
Darius English,OLB, Has tremendous length. Uses his long legs and flexible hips to merry-go-round over the edge and open a path to the quarterback. Has the long arms to develop an effective stab move as a pet pass rush option. Long strider who can cover ground and chase runners from the back-side. Former basketball player who has some coverage ability in space., He is all arms and legs. Painfully thin and lacking the necessary functional strength to hold up at the point of attack. Is widened out of the gap or washed down way too easily. Doesn't have the base to play through contact and defend the run. Will have to be a space player., PFA,," English saw a spike in his sack production this year and he does have enough athleticism to get around the corner as a rusher if his hands are right. However, he simply isn't strong enough to play on early downs and will have to convince a team that he can become a situational pass rusher."
De'Veon Smith,RB, Big back with ample vision. Plays with a feel for interior rushing lanes and is able to make multiple moves along the way. Comfortable and efficient on inside zone plays. Runs decisively. North-south runner who rarely dances. Has a late spin move and directional change to avoid square contact and fall forward. Drives legs through contact to finish. Can keep adding to rush total against arm tackles., Lacks pro acceleration needed to escape NFL linebackers to the edge. Play speed is below average. Sluggish to and through the line of scrimmage. Allows tacklers time to disengage and react to the run. Poses very little threat to take runs to the house. Hard-hat runner who lacks the wiggle or speed to create for himself. Needs it blocked up on first level to have an impact. Below average eluding tacklers in the hole., Round 7-PFA,," Teams looking for a runner with decent vision who finishes runs may have an interest in Smith, but his lack of juice or third down talent could keep his name from being called during the draft. Smith can grind out yardage between the tackles, but lacks any special qualities to help him stand out. Back end of the roster appears to be his ceiling."
Delano Hill,SS, Compact build that is able to accept and deal out physical play. Aggressive in run support. Likes the life near the line of scrimmage. Plays downhill and will meet the ball in the backfield when he gets a chance. Steps downhill from high safety and takes good angles to the ball. Plays both high and low and has matched up on the slot. Has zone-cover potential. Chest-up tackler with a good finishing rate., Hips lock up on him when trying to flip and chase the post route. Has no room for false steps in his game. Lacks athleticism to match up on space down the field. Below average play speed and range from high safety. Instincts are average. Can be slow to recognize and respond to intended misdirection. Transitions forward from his pedal will stall at the top and slow his break on the throw., Round 5-6,," Hill has the size and physical demeanor to get a quality look from a team as a box safety, but his lack of coverage quickness and ball production won't help his chances. Hill will have to open eyes on special teams and as a lights out, downhill tackler to become an NFL factor."
Dymonte Thomas,S," Plays both high safety and slot cornerback spots. Takes efficient routes to the ball from both positions. Credited with ten passes defensed in just 29 targets this season. Able to undercut a route to open a path into the throwing lane for his outstretched arm. Attacks catch point and rakes the ball away. From high-safety, will shade according to quarterback's eyes and movement in the pocket to keep himself in play-making position. Shows adequate route awareness."," Too small to play a combo safety role. Carries no thump behind his pads as a hitter and misses too many tackles. As a corner, will guess at the top of the route rather than pattern matching. Hands are below average. Watching interceptions bounce off of his hands. Not very fast. Once he's beaten, he usually can't catch up. Struggles to maintain his coverage against quick slots.", UDFA,," On the surface, he has experience at both safety and cornerback which will count as a roster plus in his favor. However, he lacks the size and physicality to handle safety duties and he doesn't have enough speed for man coverage as a cornerback. He created disruption with his passes defensed but didn't turn enough of them into interceptions to make his mark as a productive defender."
Fish Smithson,S," Plays with above average football instincts and field awareness. Good pattern recognition from two-high and single-high coverage and adjusts his coverage with haste. Quick to recognize play-action and sink into his coverage territory. Has experience covering slot. Used instincts and ball skils to defend 10-of-18 targets this season, including four interceptions. Races downhill from safety spot to jump into a contain position against the run. Shows no hesitation to plug into run fits and stick his nose in. Has potential to operate as combo safety.", Undersized for his work in the box. Tackling inconsistencies are troubling. Flat-footed tackler who takes force rather than dealing it. Has had a substantial amount of missed and broken tackles over last two seasons. Lacks the twitch to make sudden adjustments in space. Athletic limitations prevent him from making some of the plays his eyes unveil. Unable to carry speed down the field or stick with crossing routes in man., Rounds 6-7,," Smithson is a little smaller and a little slower than teams might like at the safety spot, but his instincts and overall football intelligence make up for some of his physical limitations. With six interceptions over the last two seasons, Smithson has shown that he has the ball skills to pair with his instinctive nature, but his issues finishing tackles will not be taken lightly by NFL teams. Smithson has NFL backup potential."
Joey Ivie,DT, Plays with good motor and energy throughout the snap. Plays with flexibility and desired athleticism on the move. Punches into blockers with good placement. Locates the ball quickly and works off his block to tackle. Active as a pass rusher attacking both shoulders of the blocker. Plays with quick hands in his rush and uses arm over to get over the top., Lacks mass in his lower half. Attacks upfield with a narrow base and struggles to maintain balance through contact. Gets roughed up by double teams and combo blocks and pushed out of his gap. Doesn't feature upfield juice to consistently disrupt in the gaps. Relies on motor over power and explosiveness. Doesn't make many plays despite his activity. Short arms limits his ability to control at the point of attack., UDFA,," Ivie doesn't have the power or mass to handle run-stopping duties at the point of attack and he is lacking the length teams want from 3-4 defenders. Ivie is a try-hard player who can eventually work himself into a favorable position, but he lacks the desired traits to produce on the pro level."
Karter Schult,DE, Thick chest with a broad waist. Has a single-minded approach to his job on each snap. Imposed his will against inferior competition with physicality and effort. Challenges a blocker's edge with power on pass rushes. Extremely productive sack and tackles-for-loss numbers over last two seasons. Plays with great determination and is known for his work ethic., Rushes square and lacks upper and lower flexibility to flip hips around the edge as rusher. Straight-liner with poor change of direction and agility to mirror scrambling quarterbacks and shifty runners. Short arms can leave him at the end of a tackle's punch. Pad level is too high. Below average pursuit speed and tackle range. Needs plays run at him. Pass rush lacks a counter., UDFA,, Slow-twitch power player whose lack of upfield burst and flexibility put a hard cap on his pass rush ability in the NFL. Schult's lack of length and reactive quickness will create challenges at the point of attack against the step up in competition that he will see.
Nick Mullens,QB," Good foot quickness in the pocket. Can go from play-action to pass-ready quickly. Able to bounce around and find slivers of space to cut it loose when pressure descends. Can make expedited throws from off-balance angles and hit his targets. Capable in controlled passing attack with tight release. Throws with quality touch. Exceptional toughness. Had training staff ""push the bone back in"" and stitch up a compound fracture in his thumb against Texas-San Antonio so he could finish the game.", Well below NFL norm for size. Small frame unlikely to ever carry desired mass. Lacks NFL-caliber arm to push the ball down the field and drive it between the hashes without defensive backs making plays on the ball. Will opt out of throwing from balanced platform and into back foot tosses. Doesn't bring his lower body through his throws to maximize velocity. Floats throws to field side and in the deep middle. Needs to get ball out earlier to compensate for a lack of arm., UDFA,," Mullens is a productive college quarterback with good competitiveness and toughness, but lacking the minimum standards of size and arm strength. Mullens could make it into camp, but is unlikely to find a spot on a roster."
Wes Lunt,QB, Has NFL size to stand tall in the pocket and scan the entire field. Pocket passer who plays in pro-style attack. Good ball handler in play-action and has experience in rolling out in both directions. Possesses an NFL arm that can make all the throws. Able to generate ample velocity with flick of a wrist when rushed. Able to get rid of throw quickly when he sees a target break open. Defaults to throwing ball away before forcing a dangerous throw., Statue in the pocket. Very slow in his five-step drops and in play-action. Has minimal escapability and has never been a threat with his legs. Rarely slides to safety or climbs the pocket when the edges of protection soften. Lacks poise in the face of pressure. Turtles rather than fighting through pressure to find a receiver. Ball placement inconsistent on crossing routes and field-side comebacks. Struggles to find a rhythm due to a lack of functional accuracy. Averaged less than six yards per attempt over two seasons at Illinois., UDFA,," Has NFL size and an NFL arm and he has the experience with NFL footwork that many quarterbacks lack coming out. However, Lunt's lack of mobility and his rampant inaccuracy make his NFL future a long-shot."
Will Holden,OT, Operates with adequate body control at the point of attack and in space. Efficient in his movement. Climbs to the second level and is patient before engaging. Has power in his push and can be an effective drive blocker in the running game. Technician who plays with good fundamentals to counter his athletic limitations. Very good core strength with an ability to anchor after an early bull rush. Can lock down pass rushers with his grip strength., Has some quickness limitations that will likely necessitate a move to the right side. Has short arms which affects his ability to re-direct pass rushers around the pocket once they get to his edge. Plays with relatively heavy feet and will struggle to mirror in space. Reach blocks and shutting down stunts will be challenging. Simply doesn't have enough gain in his kick slide to handle edge speed. Had trouble shutting down tackle/end twists., Round 3-4,," Three-year starter with experience at both tackle positions, Holden's lack of speed to the edge in his kick slides makes a career at the left tackle spot unlikely. He has good power as a drive blocker and should be a natural fit on the right side. Offensive line coaches will fret over his short arms, but he's a tough guy, with core strength and plus technique who can win a spot on a roster."
Zach Terrell,QB, Production and consistency are right down the middle of the fairway over the last three years. Recognizes when to make touch throws and is able to feather passes in over the top of defenders. Plus accuracy on short and intermediate throws. Throws with good ball placement. Gives Corey Davis every chance to make a play on deep balls. Is not prone to considering dangerous throws. Stays within himself and accentuates his strength. Has toughness to take the big shot and come back to make plays.," Below average height, weight and strength for an NFL quarterback. Upper body is a little busy in his set-up and release. His release contains too much wasted motion. Unable to make all of the NFL throws. Drive throws will dive. Has to put additional air on field-side throws that could turn into interceptions as a pro. Needs to throw with better anticipation. Prone to fumbles with seven this season. Benefitted from QB-friendly scheme and dominant lead receiver.", PFA,," Could be written off as a viable NFL prospect due to a lack of size and arm strength, but his accuracy, toughness and production should get him into an NFL camp. If Terrell can impress with his consistency and decision-making, he might be able to fight for a third quarterback spot in the future."
Kareem Are,OG, Has the overall mass and length that will appeal to NFL offensive line coaches. Hands take a direct track to opponent's frame when he punches. Has some pop at the end of his punch. Battles hard to stay connected with his blocks on the move. Adequate ability to pull and make contact in space. Very effective with his cut blocks., Sloppy body is carrying too much bad weight. Slow out of his stance and into lateral movement. Can't get reach blocks secured. Waist-bender whose weight is always way too far out in front. Leads with his head and feet stay way behind the action. Lacks reactive quickness to handle sudden redirection. Slow to locate twists and stunts headed his direction. Has issues anchoring against bull-rushers., UDFA,," Are has the massive frame and quality length that would be a fit at that position, but his body control and athleticism might be too far below average for it to matter. His play strength could benefit from trimming down and grinding in the weight room, but he appears to be a longshot to make a team at this point."
Erik Austell,OT," Very athletic. Plays with excellent lateral quickness. Takes effective angles on play-side, back-side and combination blocks. Has excellent timing on his work-up blocks to the second level. Has the foot quickness to mirror in space and make the necessary adjustments to land on his targets. Flexible and agile with cut blocking talent that would make Alex Gibbs happy. Displays adequate contact balance. Has good awareness pre-snap and post. Sees blitzes and responds. Always understands his assignment in the running game. Has footwork to maintain positioning in front of pass rusher.", Played a much lower level of competition. Appears unable to unlock his hips and release lower-body power. Struggles to drive block and generate movement. Has short arms and small hands and rarely owns the opponent's frame with his initial punch. Hands lack the strength to snatch and secure his blocks. May not be built for block sustaining. Could struggle to carry functional NFL weight and mass. Uses wide hands in pass pro that can turn into huggers if he feels his anchor is threatened. Bull-rushers could be a substantial problem for him with a move inside., Round 7-PFA,," Austell possesses tremendous foot quickness and overall athleticism but he lacks the length to stay at tackle and the functional power and mass to play guard. He's instinctive with a very good feel for angles and could end up becoming an eventual starter at center for a zone team if he can carry an additional 10-plus pounds, which is certainly no given."
Tony Bridges,CB, Has good height with a frame that can carry more weight. Has seen an increase in weight and muscle mass during post season training this winter. Plays with decent instincts and good anticipation from zone coverage. Is willing to lurk towards passing lanes when reading quarterback's eyes. Can read route breaks from off-man. Has length to make plays on the ball when playing forward., Hips are sticky and take entirely too long to unlock. Missing recovery speed to make up for early separation on vertical routes. Path to the throw in inconsistent robbing him of easy interceptions. Was bumped around by big receivers from press coverage. Had issues maintaining contact balance when crowding a route. Gives up too much separation space on crossing routes and digs. Scouts say playing time affected by poor long speed. Spindly tackler who will slide off of his intended target., UDFA,," Tight and slow are a tough combination of anti-traits to overcome for cornerbacks. While Bridges plays with some anticipation, he could be forced into primarily zone coverage as he allows too much separation on downfield routes. His issues with aggressiveness and consistency as a tackler will make the challenge that much tougher."
DeAngelo Brown,DT," Carries a big, thick lower body. Will flash some power at the point of attack when his pad level is right. Good arm length and can punch and press blockers off of his frame. Has adequate hand quickness. Uses arm-over as pet move to get into backfield. Was able to win and make plays in the backfield once he got to the center's edge. Had enough conditioning to play relatively high snap count for a nose.", Not much explosion out of his stance. Fails to control the neutral zone with quickness. Stiff in his lower body. Allows pad level to rise and can be knocked off-balance in his charge forward. Can be heavy-legged in pursuit. Instincts are below average and fails to work ahead of reach blocks and gets walled off. Doesn't get sink and squat into the A-gaps as a run-stuffer. Unlikely to see the field on rush downs., Round 7-PFA,," Nose tackle with a bulky lower half, but lacking the anchor expected from a two-gap interior defender. Brown has decent length and hand quickness and he's not an awful athlete, but his lateral quickness may not be where it needs to be to make plays along the interior. Brown lacks a big power trait and he's an unlikely pass rush option which means he may have to try and make a roster as a late-rounder or undrafted free agent."
Richie Brown,LB," Considered a leader on the field. Productive, two-year starter in physical SEC West. Able to maintain patience and technique when flowing to the ball. Scrapes with square shoulders and maintains his run fits. Plays with alert eyes against the run. Good recognition of misdirection and responds to ball rather than always relying on keys. Can rack up the tackles when he stays clean. Has fluid hips to drop and change direction in coverage. Plays with good awareness and shadows quarterback's eyes. Has 14 career passes defensed including five interceptions. Offers special teams cover value.", Below average functional strength. Plays light and can be engulfed by size. Lacks power in his base to hold his ground at point of attack. Offers very little pop when taking on lead blockers. Blockers are able to turn him out of his gap responsibility in run game. Has slight delay in response time against perimeter runs. Unable to consistently race ahead of climbing offensive linemen. Doesn't have the play strength for hasty disengagement when linemen get hands on him. Lacks explosiveness to play a commanding brand of football., PFA,," Brown's tackle production and instincts in coverage are fairly impressive, but he lacks the play strength and pure speed to be an every down linebacker in the NFL. He will likely need a weak-side responsibility that allows him to run and chase because he doesn't have the strength to play off of blocks and consistently make plays. His cover talent and special teams ability give him an outside shot at making a team."
Noah Brown,WR," Big receiver who plays like it. Wide frame shields defenders and maintains a catch window. Willing and able to work through traffic and can stomach collisions to secure the catch. Strong hands pluck and secure low throws and balls that sail. Uses size and strength to bully cornerbacks at top of his route when working in the end zone. Physical, fall-forward runner after catch with an effective stiff-arm to stuff tacklers. Gives as good as he gets when facing physical press corners. Able to fight through route re-direction and maintain the timing of his route. Plays the game like a battering ram at times. Committed blocker who looks to cave-in his crack blocks. Able to sustain his block and spring a run for additional yardage."," Lacks desired experience thanks to age, injury, and depth at the position over the years. Targeted just 52 times with 33 catches during his career. Short strider with below average burst off the line. Cornerbacks do not appear to fear his deep speed. Has just six catches over 20 yards. Raw route runner lacking sink and sharpness into and out of his breaks. Gives away route breaks with early deceleration. Struggles to gain anything more than functional separation against man coverage. Likely to be tasked with making contested catches as a possession receiver for entire career. Inconsistent finisher on contested catches.", Round 5-6, Vince Mayle," Brown is a big, physical possession receiver who could need additional time and coaching to accelerate the learning curve he faces due to his inexperience. While he doesn't appear to possess great vertical speed, his body control and ball tracking could tilt the odds in his favor when challenging for the 50/50 balls. If he can improve his route running and contested catches, Brown should become an NFL backup with a chance to work into a more predominant role."
Austin Calitro,LB," Highly instinctive with a strong sense for the running back's track. Quick to recognize misdirection and can be found waiting on cutback runs. Peripheral vision and feel help him avoid blocks from an angle. Strong, active hands help swipe away block attempts. Good play strength in his lower half and plays with good contact balance. Willing to step into the hole and mix it up with lead blockers. Heavy hitter who explodes into his intended targets. Tackles with fundamentals. Aware in coverage and allows quarterback's eyes to take him to the play. Finished with seven passes defensed as a two-year starter.", Below average athleticism. Plays with some tightness in his hips that becomes more obvious when he's forced to turn and run in coverage. Agility is average. Lacks desired play speed to range from sideline to sideline as an interior linebacker. Will have a limited margin for error when chasing running backs to the perimeter., Rounds 6-7, Josh Mauga," Possesses a compact frame and plays with a good motor and above average instincts that allow him to make up for some of his speed and athletic deficiencies. He is a likely inside linebacker, but he might offer some value as a 4-3 SAM linebacker. Calitro is a solid football player who finds his way to the football and his intelligence, work ethic and instincts give him a shot of becoming a quality NFL backup."
Austin Carr,WR," Highly competitive. Former walk-on with very good work ethic and confidence. Plays with toughness. Willing to make his mark over middle of the field. Extremely focused when ball is in the air. Snatches the ball out in front of his frame with strong hands. ""Touch it, catch it"" target. Able to make the combat catches in traffic. Shows ability to drop feet in bounds to secure last-second catch on sideline. Routes are run with consistent pace and rarely gives defensive backs a snap off. Uses good positioning and leverage in his routes. Finds optimal space in zones when working underneath. Effort stalk blocker who latches with inside hands and attempts to sustain in space."," Doesn't show enough sink into his breaks for sharp, angular cuts in his routes. Effort player who lacks plus athleticism and quick twitch. Process of slowing into top of route and opening to quarterback is slightly prolonged giving defenders a chance to match. Missing light feet and acceleration to uncover out of route breaks. Will sit and wait on throws rather than working back to them aggressively. Below average creativity as run-after-catch option. Not an NFL-caliber vertical threat. Will have to prove he can shake free from press and uncover against tight man.", PFA,," Self-made man whose productivity on the field this season matched up with his talent and productivity off the field. Carr is a big slot receiver who is best left to working on the first and second levels in routes that are more fluid and less angular. He's tough enough to work the middle of the field and secure throws in traffic, but scouts question whether or not he's athletic enough to get open. He's a likely undrafted free agent with an outside shot to make a roster."
Zach Cunningham,LB," Play-making machine. Plays on a downhill tilt and is always looking to draw first blood. Fast to see it, process and respond. Creates tackles for losses by shooting gaps at appropriate angles. Has a good feel for blockers and uses varied speeds and subtle upper body turns to avoid blockers on second level. Quick in his lateral scrape and races ahead of blockers. Keeps play-side shoulder uncovered when flowing to the ball. Football magnet with outstanding tackle production and ability to create and recover turnovers. Rangy long strider with instincts and play speed to carry him from sideline to sideline in search of the ball. Has extended tackle radius. Durable and reliable. Has the athleticism and awareness to handle man coverage responsibilities against running backs and tight ends. Quick to trigger on throws from zone and limit yards after catch.", Angular build with high waist and skinny legs. Lack of power in his lower body creates issues with contact balance for him. Plays behind his shoulder rather than behind his hands in take-on situations. Can get entangled against size and slow to disengage. Doesn't have play strength to fight past angle blocks once they land. Will need to work to keep shoulders squared in his attack. Leveraging his gap and standing his ground could be a challenge. Not a banger or a bend-and-strike finisher. Tends to attack ball carriers up high rather than down low and will slide off of too many would-be tackles., Round 2, Alec Ogletree," Cunningham's missed tackles and lack of desired play strength could bother teams, but his consistent production is hard to ignore. Cunningham is a rangy, three-down linebacker who has a nose for the ball and special teams value. His downhill approach is made for attacking 4-3 defenses and Cunningham could become a good, early starter as a run-and-chase weak-side linebacker."
Malachi Dupre,WR, Has desired size and athletic ability. Experienced at multiple receiver spots. More talented than production would dictate. Tracks the deep throws like an outfielder and can adjust catch positioning without taking his eye off the ball. Consistently solid catch rate throughout his career. Adjusts to low throws and balls behind him to make the catch. Looks to turn it up the field quickly after the catch. Dips low and drives through cornerbacks while stretching for additional yardage. Small sample size during freshman season gave hints of his downfield potential., Lacks upfield juice into his routes. Vertical push doesn't appear to threaten cornerbacks. Needs to play faster off the snap. Slow to sink and open on curls. Needs a greater commitment to nuances of route-running in order to improve his separation. Tends to tip his hand early allowing cornerbacks to match his patterns. Stalk-blocker with marginal aggression and sustain after initial contact., Rounds 3-4,," Big target who has suffered from arrested development due, in part, to quarterback inconsistencies at LSU. Dupre is a developmental receiver with some upside but it could take some time before he's ready to contribute. Could be a potential third or fourth wide receiver with time and coaching."
Jamal Carter,S," Has the muscular, well-proportioned build to draw oohs and aahs off the bus. Checks all the physical boxes scouts want checked. Plus athleticism with top speed to range over the top. Usually found at high safety, but has ability to cover tight ends if asked. Able to click accelerator and fire into top gear quickly. Isn't shy. Can land a heavy blow as a tackler when he's in position. Offers early special teams help.", Instincts are below average. Slow to respond to what he sees. Hesitation allows for throwing windows in the seam and over the top. Makes way too few plays on the ball. Too easily manipulated by quarterbacks. Majority of tackles happened down the field. Slow to diagnose run and race downhill to help. Tape shows mental busts that lead to big plays for opponents., PFA,," Carter is a classic height, weight, speed player who is more project than prospect at this point. Teams typically draft defenders with these types of physical and athletic attributes and attempt to mold them or turn them into special teams specialists. Carter's lack of meaningful production speaks to his instincts and how Miami used him. Single-high safety might not be the best fit for him, but he could find new life on the NFL level if a team can fit him into the right scheme."
Ukeme Eligwe,LB," Looks the part. Carries an athletic frame with well-defined legs and long arms. Keeps pads square to the line of scrimmage on a consistent basis when sifting through traffic and flowing to the ball. Occasionally flashes a big, downhill burst when he's free to race on an angle to a play-side run. Length allows him to dive and sprawl for additional tackle radius when pursuing to the edge. Willing to set a hard, inside shoulder against pulling guards to spill the run outside to a teammate. Asked to carry some man coverage responsibilities down the field. Matched up against Evan Engram on a few snaps and hung in. Is a freight train to the quarterback as a blitzer. Forced three fumbles this season.", Play strength doesn't always match impressive frame. Needs to drop pad level when engaging at point of attack for increased power. Ducks head when taking on blockers and can lose sight of running back. Focuses on blockers rather than playing through them. Can get glued to blocks and is slow to shed. Needs to improve technique and hand usage in order to punch and control. Lacks instincts. Is a step slow to read keys and flow to the ball. Late start allows linemen to climb up and land blocks. Straight-liner with poor stop-start quickness and change of direction. Booted out of the Florida State program and character will have to be vetted., Rounds 6-7, Christian Jones," Highly-touted, four-star prospect out of high school, Eligwe passes the eyeball test with flying colors. He is a straight-line player who struggles to change direction in space and needs to keep plays in front of him. His lack of anticipation and instincts could cause teams to try him as a strong-side 4-3 linebacker rather than inside. He has the physical traits and potential that should land him on a practice squad with an outside shot of making a roster."
Jeremy Cutrer,CB, Tall with disruptive length when challenging the deep throws. Utilizes timing and full arm extension to wall off throwing window from trail coverage. Ball production was good with 29 passes defensed over his two seasons. Allowed just one touchdown over his last 52 targets. Has cover experience in a variety of coverages and techniques. Footwork generally solid from press and operates with smooth natural backpedal from off-man. Able to transition forward from pedal without many false steps. More than willing to put in work in run support. Makes good decisions about when to dart in and when to play off of stalk blocks. Strikes with force and runs through pass catchers when he gets a chance. Goes low to take legs out from under runners.," Stringy, rail-thin frame doesn't carry enough desired mass. Can be turned inside out by clever route specialists. Falls off-balance when he tries to punch outside release and misses. Doesn't have the makeup speed to overcome early deficits against vertical racers. Allows too much workable separation on in-breaking and comeback routes. Instincts and route anticipation is below average. Spirit is willing but the frame is weak as a tackler. Musters as much force as he can, but may lack the muscle and size to tackle bigger receivers and running backs without breaking down.", Round 7-PFA,," His height and overall length is a checkmark in his favor and Cutrer also possesses a level of smoothness and athleticism in his coverage. Cutrer's play speed is just average and his lack of functional bulk will definitely concern teams. Cutrer has the ability to make plays on the ball, but his lack of anticipation coupled with the separation he allows underneath could make reaching his ball production potential a challenge on the NFL level."
Jerod Evans,QB," Burly frame that can absorb punishment and hand it out if necessary. Absolute load bearing pillar workhorse for the Virginia Tech offense this season. Adequate release point to avoid excessive batted balls. A little muscled, but has some heat on his throws. Has arm for deep outs and to challenge safeties. Able to challenge the tight windows without having high number of throws knocked away. Willing to look beyond simple throws and wait for second level targets to uncover. Needs more consistency, but ended up throwing with solid accuracy on deep shots down the sideline. Was third in the conference to Deshaun Watson and Lamar Jackson in completions of 20-plus yards. Mobile with ability to avoid pressure late in the rush. Will extend and continue to look for a shot down the field. Can move the chains with his legs as scrambler and on designed runs. First down-maker on short yardage runs. Has athleticism to operate as a roll-out passer.", Played in just 14 FBS games. Protected by quarterback-friendly offense with quick-hitters and several pre-determined throws. Mechanics in lower half are very raw and in need of plenty of work. Accuracy issues on simple throws are often tied to his spotty footwork and rushed delivery. Platform at delivery is uneven and inconsistent. Weight transfer comes to abrupt halt in his follow-through. Ball comes out janky. Has a tendency to expedite screen throws rather than keeping his eyes down the field and letting them develop. Will stare down his primary target. Doesn't always pick up safeties after snap and will opportunities to hit free-runners in the seam. Too much hesitation in his decision-making. Brings the gas on short throws that require touch. Deep balls tend to be too flat. Poor ball placement leaving too many throws behind his targets or too far out in front on crossing routes., Rounds 5-6, Kevin Hogan," Jerod Evans is a projection-based project as a quarterback. Has baseline accuracy and field reading is nowhere near where it needs to be and his mechanics will require extensive work. However, he has good size, is extremely competitive and has enough physical ability as a passer and a scrambler to make him a draft and stash quarterback."
Treston Decoud,S," Has outstanding size with long arms. Recognizes misdirection and plays with decent football instincts. Patient feet from press coverage. Can be physical through the route. Quick to body up and crowd an outside release against the sideline. Experienced in a variety of coverage. Held talented Cal wideout, Chad Hansen, to just four catches for sixteen yards. Eyeballs quarterback from zone and has good response time relative to quarterback's release. Aggressive tackler who steps downhill looking to finish in run support. Works off of blocks and into tackle position. Drives into his target, wraps, and tackles.", Gets behind early when pressing receivers with release quickness off the snap. Backpedals from a narrow base with labored feet. Will lose some balance and body control when forced to transition against in-breaking routes. Takes way too many false steps when attempting to sink and trigger on the throw from his pedal. Doesn't have the sudden closing burst to defend what he sees in coverage. Had just two interceptions (both in one game) over 104 targets. Play speed is slightly below average. Unable to squeeze routes enough to make quarterbacks uncomfortable from off-man., Rounds 6-7,," Treston's size and physicality are two traits that some teams will covet on draft day, but there are some coverage limitations that push him towards a cover-2 defense. DeCoud lacks the trigger quickness to close separation windows that open against him, so a team may try and convert him into a free safety role where his coverage and tackling may be a fit as a backup."
Gehrig Dieter,WR, Good height with a frame that can carry more weight. Tape from Bowling Green was substantially better. Showed off impressive hand-eye coordination and focus. Drives back to the ball and snatches it away from his frame. Has ability to torment cornerbacks on fade routes. Delays attempt to reach for lobs to prevent cornerbacks from reading his eyes. Tape shows hand strength to make the circus catches. Body control and balance are generally good. Competitive runner after the catch. Willing blocker who works behind his frame. Squares up defenders and strikes with good snap on his punch. Snatches and rides to help soften edge for running backs., Time speed is below average and play speed looked even slower this year. Appeared to lack confidence. Hands went from good to bad in one season. Struggled with focus drops and finishing contested catches. Need scheme to open him up and struggled to uncover against man coverage all season. Route strength doesn't match his size. Slowed badly by contact inside his routes and rarely displayed ability to adjust routes. Routes are dull and rounded. Lacks acceleration out of break points. Failed to produce at expected levels this year., UDFA,," Dieter's ball skills caught my eye when I studied him this summer, but the step up from Bowling Green to Alabama as a graduate transfer appeared to overwhelm him this season. Dieter's play speed and athleticism are underwhelming and he is unable to show off his strong hands and abilities near the goal line if he's not in the game. His size and ability to block are intriguing, but if he can't get open with speed or quickness, it likely won't matter."
Hunter Dimick,DE," Produced at a high level over his last three seasons. Has power that allows him to drop anchor and set a strong edge. Held his own at point of attack against USC's Zach Banner who outweighed Dimick by about 90 pounds. Plays with good balance and maintains body control throughout the rep allowing for functional change of direction. Possesses a quick spin move to disengage from blocks. Gets into defender's frame early with his hands. Keeps his engine running throughout the play. Won't quit on the play if initial rush gets stalled. Uses choppy, active feet to juke and dart to the blocker's edge when he can. Does a good job of stuffing cut attempts while keeping his eyes in the backfield. Extremely intelligent with an ability to operate in more complicated schemes."," Has physical deficiencies that will be a turn-off to most teams. Barrel-chested with thin, smooth calves. Arm length measured at sub 30 inches this spring, which is exceptionally short. Hips are wound too tightly to get out of the starter's blocks with much juice. Short-stepper up the pass rush arc. Tackles have time to meet him at the edge. Face-up rusher who is unable to flip hips around the edge and has to rely on a full body turn. Not a natural bender. Pad level will rise too tall when he's on the move. Lacks agility and lateral quickness to avoid being reached by blockers. Won't be a dynamic stack-and-shed playmaker at the point of attack on next level.", Round 7-PFA,," Dimick's sack production is quite impressive, but the question becomes whether or not those numbers are translatable on the next level. He has the power to hold up at the point of attack, but his lack of length will be a big issue against NFL tackles as a rusher. Dimick has a terrific motor and impressive body control, but his best fit could be as a backup strong-side 3-4 outside linebacker who can stand and thump on tight ends as an early-down player."
Tyquwan Glass,CB, Keeps eyes trained on quarterback from his backpedal in off-coverage. Has decent footwork to match route breaks from backpedal. Confident working off the ball in man or zone. Plays the catch point roughly. Active hands claw and scrape at the ball with well-timed aggressiveness. Finished with 21 passes defensed in 87 targets over two seasons as starter. Willing to step downhill once he diagnoses run. Throws cross-body blocks at the thighs of big running backs to bring them down. Loves to wallop ball carriers with a stiff forearm shiver when he gets the chance. Has kick and punt return experience., Has hip tightness causing delays in his transitions. Struggles to open up and accelerate without giving up additional separation on vertical routes. Long speed is below average. Allows too many catches in front of his face. Anticipation is below average and can be slow to read and break on three-step drops. Not enough heat behind his click-and-close. Will need to squeeze routes tighter in order to see an NFL field. Needs to sink into the chest of receivers to crowd their catch-radius when tracking the deep ball. More of a hitter than tackler., UDFA,," Glass has decent size, athleticism and ball skills when it's time to contest the catch, but his lack of anticipation and long speed is a concern. Glass is an adequate tackler and may have a shot in a zone-based coverage scheme, but without better instincts and burst on the throw, he may not make enough plays to stick around on a roster."
Randall Goforth,S," Three-year starter. Competitive team-first player with good football character. Stepped into cornerback, punt return and kick return duties against Arizona State due to injuries. Two-way player in high school with experience at receiver. Uses ball skills and big hands to take away throws in his area. Has springy feet and is capable in man coverage. Quick to click-and-close from off positioning with limited false steps. Has a good feel for space when asked to play zone. Pattern reader who jumps a route if receiver gives it away. Very good football intelligence and understood how to play all secondary spots. Does not lack toughness and is willing to do his part as face-up tackler.", Undersized for the safety position and will be forced into slot coverage. Is a little bit tight-hipped in his transitions from press. Can get too upright causing delayed change of direction when fooled by an inside release or route stem. Lacks play strength to crowd physical receivers along their routes without getting jostled out of position. Has troubling missed tackle numbers over the last two seasons. Has to land squarely or ball carriers knife right through his tackle attempts. Quicker than fast. Has limited coverage experience on special teams., PFA,," Goforth is a heady competitor with adequate foot quickness and an ability to handle coverage responsibilities from off-man and zone. Goforth's lack of size, plus-speed, and consistent tackling create a challenge in making a roster and he will likely have to take the undrafted free agent route into a camp."
Chris  Godwin,WR,,,,,
Ralph Green III,DT, Possesses decent length with good overall size on his frame. Gets up the field with initial quickness and can be disruptive against zone plays. Has experience at both the 3- and 5-techniques. Has the size and length to potentially fit as a 3-4 defensive end. Has power in his upper body to punch and press blockers off his frame. Shows an ability to anchor and stuff double teams when he has his feet set and pad level right. Uses effective arm-over move to swim into backfield and create tackles for loss., Works upright and without desired knee bend at point of attack. Somewhat leggy for an interior defender and ends up on ground too often. Allows base to get too narrow when working laterally. Elevated pad level creates issues with contact balance when redirected. Marginal tackle and sack production. Finished with just 4.5 sacks in four years. Doesn't have the feet or overall quickness to outwork blocker around the edge as rusher. Initial rush plan can stall very quickly. Had four offsides penalties this season., PFA,," Green is a little leggy and upright, causing balance issues when he doesn't bend and widen out his base, but he does flash some pop at the point of attack. Green's production level was lower than it should have been considering his physical talent, but he could benefit if he gets paired with a team who allows him to stick in a 2-gapping scheme up front. With very limited pass rush potential, Green's ceiling might be as a backup interior lineman."
Jermaine Grace,LB," Good athletic ability. Can mirror running backs along their track and redirect himself when it's time to change directions. Fluid with the play speed to chase from sideline to sideline and make tackles down the field. Looks for opportunities to play downhill. Plays with patience, but will race into a gap when he gets a chance. Tackles with a wide base and strikes from his hips into a wrap-up tackle. Has stronger base than expected for his size. Lands first with his hands. Uses quick punch and extension to keep from being engulfed by size. Has upper body strength to shed blockers and look for the ball. Has quickness and agility to cover man-to-man in space. Had nine special teams tackles as a sophomore.", Built like a safety with a thin waist and an angular frame. Unlikely to carry desired weight for the position as a pro. Will misread his keys and get taken out of position by misdirection. Instincts are average and he can be a little slow to diagnose and chase. Finds himself engaged in blocks that he should be able to race in front of. Gets shoulders turned in his lateral pursuit and can be washed down and out of the play in space. Needs to play with better knee bend to maintain his leverage as a hitter. Missed all of 2016 after being dismissed from the team for improper benefit violations., PFA,," Grace has the athleticism play speed to carry him around the field and to the ball, but he could be hard-pressed to find an NFL team who is willing to draft him considering his lack of functional weight. He was a linebacker coming out of high school so it is unlikely that a team will see him as a hybrid safety/linebacker on the next level. His cover skills and special teams ability will have to be sharp to open a door in camp to make a roster."
Nate Hairston,CB, Has good size and well-built lower body. Built like a more physical player and lives up to it. Competes hard when the ball heads his way. Will knife in at full-speed when he reads hitch or wide receiver screen. Quick to shuck and attack in run support. Former wide receiver at Temple who plays with fluid movement in space. Loose hips allow for smooth transitions in matching patterns and longer strides in space. Has adequate foot quickness and twitch. Plays with a good feel for coverage responsibilities. Diligent to protect against speed and is rarely beaten over the top., Only one season as a full-time starter. Targeted just 36 times in college with only six passes defensed. Man cover skills are work in progress. Footwork can be a little uneven in his backpedal and transitions. Will panic and face guard rather than finding the ball when he gets beat over the top. Protected somewhat by cover-2 and cover-3 looks. Needs more man experience. Scouts question his long speed. Leaves an excessive buffer in his bail technique leading to easy completions underneath., Round 5-6,, Raw but very moldable prospect. Hairston shows good awareness from zone and his physical style and willingness to come tackle make him an immediate fit for primarily zone cover teams. However he may have the tools to eventually become a solid bump-and-run cornerback as he becomes more experienced at the position. Hairston is a projection-based talent who should become a much better player in two years than he is today.
Karel Hamilton,WR, Dips shoulder to sink under redirect attempts early in the route. Uses frame to create space at the top of his routes. Does a nice job of shielding cornerbacks from the throw and is able to secure contested catches. Works back to his quarterback. Generally a hands-catcher but will body it in traffic. Athletic in mid-air with ability to make difficult adjustments to the throw. Plus ball tracking skills. Finds the ball early and can adjust path to the ball accordingly., Shows tendency to wait on deep balls rather than attacking at high points. Play speed is below average. Marginal speed into his routes and cornerbacks can squat on his underneath work. Herky-jerky into his breaks with flailing arms and busy lower body. Below average separation quickness out of routes. Hard to find his burst gear on tape. Lack of release quickness is likely to get him hung up by press corners on next level. Average after the catch., PFA,, Hamilton was a workhorse for Samford handling a heavy target load that included catch-and-run work on wide receiver screens. He has decent size and plus ball skills but lacks separation quickness and speed to get open. Has a shot as a possession receiver if he can prove he can make the contested catches on the next level.
Derek Griffin,WR, Highly-touted prospect coming out of high school in both football and basketball. Has rare size with basketball agility. SWAC Player of the Year in men's basketball in 2015. Overall length combined with leaping ability gives him an enormous advantage near goal line. Long strider with build-up speed and a second gear when the ball is in the air. Showed some ability to work underneath on slants and digs., Scouts say basketball is way ahead of football as his first love. Considered unreliable by coaching staff. Suspended multiple times and kicked off TSU football team for violations. Gangly frame lacks playing strength. Can be redirected and jostled inside his route. Limited speed into his routes. Has to prove he can defeat press coverage. Defaults to body catches. Effort level is below average as run blocker., PFA,," Scouts say he will need additional work and reps to process an NFL playbook and that his football character is well-below the NFL standard. While Griffin has exciting physical traits and potential as a project, he hasn't proven he can stay in one spot and excel at any point since high school. A team could take a late-round shot at him, but if not, he'll be a priority free agent who could find an early practice squad home while teams determine his love for the game."
Treyvon Hester,DT, Has decent power at the point of attack. Fairly athletic. Shows an ability to shed quickly to make tackles. Good reactive quickness allows for sudden shifts to make tackles against running backs trying to dart through gaps nearby. Highly instinctive. Keys on his man pulling and will work around the down-block coming his way to scrape and follow the play. Initial quickness laterally is solid. Effective arm over frees him from a block on his edge. Has very active hands as a rusher. Swipes and chops consistently at blocker's punch to try and keep himself clean. Able to maneuver around pass blocks if he gets an early advantage., Plays too straight-legged. Base is often way too narrow in his operation. Plays with inconsistent pad level. Shows issues with contact balance when he's playing too tall. Inconsistent get-off into the neutral zone. Will drop head into his initial contact and lose sight of the ball at times. Motor will fizzle out the longer a rep lasts. Pursuit effort can run hot and cold. Effort rusher who may not have the skill level to play on pass downs., Round 6-7,," Three-technique with good size and quickness, Hester plays with active hands and he has a shot to become a disruptive, rotational defensive tackle if he can continue to improve at the point of attack."
Brian Hill,RB, Has size of an every-down NFL back. Effort level runs high on each snap. Does a nice job of allowing lead blockers to usher him to perimeter freedom on sweeps. Confident and effective over tackles and around the end. Can crank it to top speed quickly once he turns the corner. Functional strength in lower body provides balance through contact. Legs rip through arm tackles. Runs with bend and leverages lead shoulder as blunt force into second-level tacklers. Has some lateral glide to slide away from tackle attempts and bounce it. Plays like it matters to him. Fumbled once in 349 carries in 2016. Understands protection responsibilities. Squares blitzers and gives vigorous effort as a blocker., Inside runs can be a little heavy-footed and lack tempo. Not a naturally instinctive runner. Vision isn't as clear as you would like along interior. Runs with some hesitation between tackles and will drop his head and bull forward rather than continuing to probe with wide eyes. Needs better timing for burst-gear through the crease. Can get caught up in the muck. Could use better finesse with his feet and his elusiveness is slightly below average. Is always in a rush and tends to crowd his blockers while they are trying to work. Heavy two-year workload included 630 carries., Round 4, Latavius Murray," Hill has a good combination of size and speed and is able to grind out additional yardage for himself but is not necessarily a power runner. Hill is not a rhythmic runner and may need a clearly defined run track. His experience in a running scheme that featured gap, power and zone plays should help him acclimate quickly into an NFL running game as he competes to eventually become a committee running back with some value as a third-down pass protector."
Elijah Hood,RB," Big and powerful with well-muscled build and huge traps. Decisive runner who lacks speed, but can get into his top gear early in his rep. Instinctive and will accelerates through contact with pretty good contact balance to keep runs alive. Shows ability to slash through arm tackles and is always looking to fall forward. Drives his feet through tackle attempts and is credited with 28 broken tackles over his last two seasons. Used in pass protection and as a lead blocker at times in Tar Heels running game. Throws an effective cut block in space. In pass pro, launches his weight into pass rushers and gives them something to think about. Functional pass catcher with above average hands and an ability to dig out the low throws."," Lacks speed to live a life other than that of a grinder. Will be unable to get around the edge on a consistent basis against NFL linebackers. Slow to gather, cut and get back into the flow of the run. Early traffic in the backfield is his nemesis. Lacks the agility and elusiveness to be a creative back on the first and second levels. Needs a point of entry to be effective. Hammerhead style won't allow him to get skinny and bleed through the creases. Lacks subtle shifts to convert downhill, short yardage attempts.", PFA,," Downhill runner who lacks desired elusiveness, lateral quickness and speed, but does have the overall power to create for himself. Hood is a banger who will only be a fit for certain systems, but he does have the toughness to handle pass protection duties. Hood's ability to block in the open field could open a door for him as a roster-friendly fullback with third or fourth running ability."
Roderick Johnson,OT, Exceptionally long with well-proportioned frame. Looks the part. Has telephone poles for arms. Unfurls his length and consistently jabs into defenders with maximum arm extension. Punch can be very disruptive for edge rushers who have to alter their rush plans. Plus power as a run blocker. Can finish with authority once he latches into the defender's frame and gets momentum churned up. Shows ability to make late adjustments in space. Gathers weight and focuses power into opponent at point of attack. Massive wingspan can buy him time to recover against sudden changes of direction. Plays with good awareness. Sees blitzers lurking and is ready to respond. Good transition speed to slide from his stance. Can snap and catch E/Ts. Plays with a very stiff outside hand in pass protection., High-cut waist bender and leaner who is constantly playing with his weight way out in front of his feet. Plays with an alarming lack of body control and balance. Weight is rarely centered. Big feet get tripped up too often. Pass slides lack proper base width and control. Allows his feet to cross over causing regrettable change of direction attempts against inside counters. Hands and feet are in disharmony and need to get synced. Straight-legged into contact. Always in a race to get to the edge in pass pro causing him to panic and lunge. Takes questionable angles when attempting to seal. Power seems to be an issue with redirect blocks. Has athletic traits but doesn't always manifest itself in play. Sluggish with lateral movement., Round 3-4, Morgan Moses," Long-limbed left tackle who has the physical traits that teams want from their blind-side protector, but who is missing some of the body control and balance that is needed to succeed at his position. Despite his balance inconsistencies, Johnson can be a powerful run blocker when he gets defenders framed up. Teams will have to decide if they want to play him on the left or right side, but an offensive line coach will need to try and correct issues with his pass sets and his footwork before he gets his shot."
Zack Johnson,OG," Big and wide. Carries functional girth and power on his frame. Plays with good upper body strength and can hold his own as a base blocker matched against power. Aggressive at the point of attack. Can generate push as down blocker to widen out the rushing lane. Not considered a plus athlete, but plays with decent body control and balance throughout the rep. Appears to work around his limitations. Showed off ability to drop anchor against bull-rushers at the Shrine practices.", Upright and stiff when asked to get out in space as a pull blocker. Struggles to find a point of leverage at impact due to his elevated pad level. Unable to make sudden redirections to land against moving targets in space. Phone booth worker who is unlikely to get to proper angles on the second level. Footwork can be ragged. Needs to do a better job of altering his blocks and picking up free linebackers on short pulls. Will lean a little in pass pro. Loses early arm extension due to a lack of arm length., PFA,," Big-boned, short-armed guard lacking in athleticism and knee bend, but possessing the desired level of power for a phone booth mauler. Johnson's tape isn't all that dynamic and hearing his name called on Day 3 might be a stretch, but his burly frame and core strength will likely land him in the camp of a team looking for power on the inside."
Aaron Jones,RB,,,,,
Jadar Johnson,S, Looks like an NFL safety in the uniform. Well defined upper body with broad shoulder and athletic trunk. Explosive athlete with very good ball skills. Good closing burst on the throw. Former AAU hooper who jumps like a dunk championship contestant and times the high point like a rebounder. Instinctive in coverage. Long strider with range to play in the deep middle and the hand-eye coordination to consistently challenge the long throw. Uses a smart approach to challenge catch point ripping at receivers arms. Had just one interference penalty this season despite his aggressive attempts to play the ball (12 passes defensed including five interceptions). Should be an immediate special teams contributor in coverage., Has just one season of experience as a starter. Can be way too chatty in media sessions providing bulletin board material to opponents. Still needs plenty of work with his run support. Could use more urgency in his pursuit. Makes too many assumptions that teammates will finish the tackle. Needs to use hands aggressively to punch and shuck blocking receivers. Takes poor downhill angles to the football losing his leverage to the sideline. Too many arm tackles lead to high missed tackle count., Round 5-6, Tashaun Gipson," Explosive height, weight, speed prospect with terrific ball skills but an inconsistent approach in run support. Johnson's ball production, despite just one season as a starter, will likely give a team confidence that he will continue to shine in that area on the next level. Johnson has starting NFL potential and a strong workout could push him up the draft board. However, he must improve his run support to be a long-time starter in the league."
Javancy Jones,DE, Scouts rave about his his intelligence and character. Leadership galore. Rare four-year captain. Big linebacker and put-together. Has desired length and hand strength. Quick processor with above average read and response time. Uses sudden hands to work around blocks. Closes on ball carriers with good acceleration and lands heavy pads as a tackler. Doesn't shy away from physicality of the game., Played outside in college but may have to transition inside to middle linebacker and learn a new position. Short-stepper with limited speed and overall play range. Stiff lower body operates with below average bend and leverage at the point of attack. Needs faster disengage when tied up. Lacks reactive athleticism to be a full-time playmaker. Likely to struggle if forced into coverage., Round 7-PFA,," Jones has good size and physicality and will get home run grades for leadership and character, but making a roster out of camp could be difficult. He's not a naturally agile, flexible athlete to begin with and he may be forced to learn a new position on the next level."
Josh Jones,S, Possesses prototypical combination of size and speed. Has acceleration and top-end speed to range all over the field. Plus athletic ability and reactive quickness. Has ability to disguise his coverage before sprinting back to centerfield. Has experience with both safety spots. Fluid in his movement and is an explosive leaper when challenging at the high-point. Has the ball skills to rake it or take it. Plays with eager eyes that stay glued to quarterback's intentions. Has the closing burst to challenge throws. Extremely aggressive. Bouncy feet can't wait to fire downhill and hit something. Accelerates through the collision. Does a good job of punching and playing off of blockers.," His aggression is a double-edged sword. Will come in too hot looking to lay the lumber and end up missing his mark as a tackler. Needs to do better job of coming to balance as a tackler. From zone coverage, can be a little slow to anticipate routes and squeeze the throwing windows. Gets hyper-focused on quarterback and will lose track of his assignments. Will bite on play-action bait and get drawn out of position.", Round 2, Mike Mitchell," Jones is a height-weight-speed prospect to be sure, but he's not just a traits-based safety. Jones has the appetite for hitting that teams will want around the box and he has the speed and ball skills to range and help against vertical threats from a deep safety spot. The big area of concern will be Jones' ability to play with better discipline in coverage and as a tackler. He has the ability to become a good, long-time starter in the league."
Jerome Lane,WR, Big body usually dwarfs cornerbacks across from him. Posted eye-popping production in his two seasons as a receiver. Cornerbacks better strap it up because he is physical inside the route. Creates late separation with his hands and body. Finds deep ball and works back to underthrown balls aggressively. Is a bull with the ball in his hands and can drag tacklers down the field after the catch. Almost 75 percent of his catches over the last two seasons moved the chains. Background as a linebacker makes him a perfect candidate for early special teams coverage work., Still very raw with just two years experience as a receiver. Looks slow into his routes and down the sideline on verticals. Showed very little ability to be able to get a head start on NFL caliber cornerbacks and climb over the top of them. Was often tasked with making contested catches due to a lack of separation. Athletic ability is below average. Tight-hipped runner with very little sink into his breaks or explosion coming out., PFA,," While Lane is still very raw and continuing to learn the position and the art of route-running, it is hard to imagine him gaining much more functional speed or athleticism. His hands are adequate and he has very good size and strength so it might make sense to beef Lane up and give him a shot at a move tight end spot if he fails to make it as a receiver. Lane will find his way into camp but it might be a challenge to make a roster."
Elijah Lee,LB, Possesses angular build with long arms. Won't just give in to size. Works hard to constrict running lanes and will fire downhill into the gaps when they present themselves. Showed off impressive long speed and closing burst when chasing down ball carriers against Texas A&M; in the Texas Bowl. Squares up in the hole and meets running backs heads up. Productive and disruptive behind the line of scrimmage. Rangy. Shows ability to navigate both high and low in weaving through the bodies in his pursuit to the ball. Adequate awareness in space in man coverage. Has athleticism and ball skills to stay on the field for all three downs., Missing the sand in his pants to power up and take on blocks effectively. Lacks instincts and feel for cutback lanes and counters. Can be goaded into false steps. Below average hand usage. Will need to learn to punch and separate or he could be overwhelmed by linemen. Plays too tall when sifting through the flow of traffic and will miss too many tackles. Needs to do better job of finding the ball in coverage. Too many ankle tackles rather than running through the target with a clean finish., Rounds 6-7,," Lee's playing style is more subtle than it is urgent and his upright playing style limits his tackling efficiency and suddenness in his change of direction. Lee has the speed to range all over the field and has the ball skills to warrant consideration on passing downs. If a linebacker coach can get him to play with better bend and get the play speed to match the timed speed, Lee could become an eventual starter in the league."
Alex Kozan,OG, Functional movement as pull blocker. Plays under control with skip-pulls and generally operates with good radar to find his work. Technically sound player. Plays under control with efficient feet. Operates with good timing on combo blocks and rarely gets cheated on secure block. Understands athletic limitations and adjusts his second-level angles accordingly. Has adequate core strength and can battle back against power players. Able to sink and anchor against bull rushers. Coachable and consistent.," Is a little fleshy around the midsection. Below average athletic ability. Plays with some leg stiffness when asked to move in space and is labored out of stance in lateral movements. Will struggle to get to his reach blocks and win. Can take early losses when matched against athletes at point of attack. Feet are sluggish laterally in pass pro. Will lunge a bit rather than mirror when rusher gets to his edge. Would generate better arm extension with quicker, more compact punch.", PFA,," Scrappy guard with average power and limited athletic ability who still finds ways to maintain a level of consistency as a blocker. Kozan doesn't have any of the physical or athletic traits that will help him stand out, but he's a coachable tough guy who should find his way into a camp and put together some solid reps. If Kozan can take some snaps and offer center flexibility, that might help his chances to make a roster."
Marlon Mack,RB, Looks like he has ball bearings in his hips. Able to swivel in multiple directions. Can tilt and slalom around defenders on the second and third level and is able to string moves together. Has slippery feet and is hard to pin down when bouncing laterally. Runs with knee bend and his pad level is low at contact. Explosive burst carries him into his getaway gear. Able to run away from tacklers. Six of his fifteen touchdowns this year went for 43-plus yards. Always plays fast. Contain buster to the outside. Finds ways to slither out of tackles. Hands showed improvement as pass catcher.," Runs with inconsistent power through contact. Will need to accelerate through contact on next level. Serial run bouncer. Too willing to make wild bounces to the furthest reaches of the perimeter if interior lanes are gummed up. Lacks a committed approach between the tackles. Feet start dancing if he doesn't see an early point of entry. On jet sweeps, he rarely looked to cut it downhill in space and defaulted to the wide track. Has a very poor fumble rate over this three years and has put the ball on the ground twelve times. Ducks head into traffic to finish rather than keeping eyes scanning.", Round 3-4, Denard Robinson," Scat back with decent size and blazing getaway speed. Mack has plenty of wiggle to bounce from run lane to run lane and make tacklers miss, but he has a penchant for looking to break runs way outside when the interior becomes too trafficked and he won't be able to get away with that against NFL speed. Mack is a complementary runner who can hit big runs against defenses who have been worn down, but he needs to be matched with the right scheme in order to unlock his big-play potential."
Jeremiah Ledbetter,DE," Compact, powerful frame. Explodes into blockers with good hip torque and consistently wins the battle of low-man at the point of attack. Has the arm length of an offensive tackle. Early with his punch and lands with good placement. Gets quick arm extension and is able to control the point of attack when asked to two-gap. Stronger than size would dictate and can handle himself against single blocks. Does his part to eat blocks when asked to in Arkansas scheme. Has power to drive through a guard's edge once he makes his way up the field.", Has physical limitations that could mitigate his effectiveness. Will need substantially more mass to handle duties as an NFL three-technique. Can be uprooted by down blocks and double teams and driven out of his gap. Lacks initial upfield explosiveness teams look for from penetrators. Could be a man without a clear-cut position. Struggles to get to blocker's edge as a rusher. Needs to find more pass rush. Will need to improve hand fighting for faster wins to compensate for his average athleticism., Round 4-5,," Ledbetter's game is built for the interior line, but he lacks the desired mass to hold his ground against NFL power and he's not as explosive off the snap as teams would like to play in the gaps. Ledbetter's long arms and power at the point of attack might make him a candidate to play base end for a team looking for strength on the edge, but the lack of foot quickness and ability to threaten the edge as an interior rusher could limit his draft value."
Patrick Mahomes,QB," Possesses NFL body type for work inside and out of the pocket. Has an undeniable swagger and confidence to his game. Accuracy has improved in each season since his freshman year. Naturally accurate in his every day throws. Comfortable challenging defenders in space. Has arm strength and fearlessness to attack the cover-2 voids down the sideline. Can make deep, field side throws. Cranks up velocity to fit passes into tight windows. Former pitcher who propels hips through his release with aggressive torque and never gets cheated on his follow-through. Can deliver strikes from a variety of arm angles. Expedites release on RPOs (run-pass option) or when pressure is mounting in pocket. Puts effort into play-action fakes. Relaxed and effective when throwing on the move. Can be a legitimate dual-threat in a boot-action offense. Improved his eye manipulation over the years and will eyeball linebackers to hold them while patterns unfold around them. Has pocket mobility to escape pressure and the poise to extend plays and find alternate targets. Hands are very strong. Can pump and reset without issues. Competes as a runner and is willing to go the extra mile for the first down.", Can be inconsistent in his approach. Needs to play inside the offense and show more discipline. Too eager to go big game hunting. Ravenous appetite for the explosive play can also bring unwanted trouble. Willingness to default to playground style appears to limit his ability to get into a consistent rhythm. Needs to improve anticipatory reads and learn to take what the defense gives him. Decision making can go from good to bad in a moment's notice. Operates from a narrow base and allows his upper body and arm to race ahead of his feet. Has a dip and wind-up in his standard release. Explosive delivery and follow-through causes some throws to sail. Needs better touch on intermediate and deep balls. Carries ball a little low in the pocket. Impatient. Will leave pocket prematurely rather than standing in and winning in rhythm. Better as a scrambler than pure runner. Looked a little less mobile in the open field this season., Round 1-2, Jay Cutler," Mahomes is a big, confident quarterback who brings a variety of physical tools to the party, but he's developed some bad habits and doesn't have a very repeatable process as a passer. Mahomes' ability to improvise and extend plays can lead to big plays for his offense, but he will have to prove he can operate with better anticipation and be willing to take what the defense gives him in order to win from the pocket. Mahomes will be a work in progress, but he's a high ceiling, low floor prospect."
Keevan Lucas,WR, Plays tall near the goal line with good high pointing skills and body control to win the ball. Good catch-to-touchdown ratio over last two seasons. Hands are generally soft and he can drop low to make a catch. Works the middle of the field. Able to concentrate and secure throws in traffic. Adjusts in space depending on coverage in order to create more accessible throwing lane for quarterback. Former 200-meter runner in high school with some build-up speed in his go routes., Plays with hip stiffness. Uses excessive foot chop to gather before breaking his route inside. Unable to bend and sink into his breaks forcing him to make rounded cuts. Gives away routes early and doesn't play with enough acceleration out of his breaks to make up for it. Hands can be inconsistent with focus drops becoming an issue. Doesn't have get-away athleticism to consistently avoid tackles and pick up yards after catch. Run blocking effort isn't on par., PFA,," Linear, high-cut slot receiver with decent build up speed who lacks the flexibility for precise route to uncover against tight man coverage. Lucas has been productive during his tenure at Tulsa, but he doesn't appear to have the short-area quickness teams look for from an NFL slot."
Josh Malone,WR,,,,,
Damien Mama,G," Big boy with NFL frame. Good posture in his pass sets with hands in punch-ready position in front of his chest, knees bent and back flat. Punch is as stiff as a boxing jab. Uncorks hands early and lands with force behind maximum arm extension. Anchors against bull rushers with adequate knee-bend and can slow their charge. Has dropped about 75 pounds since coming to USC. With less weight has come more lateral quickness to reach and sustain in space. Skip-pull steps are clean and is able to work long and short pulls. Adequate radar in space to find and make second-level blocks."," Was stuck in a battle for starting position to open season due to lack of accountability and consistency. Has too much bad weight around his midsection. Formerly 400 pounds so weight will have to be monitored carefully. Narrow base causes limited power zone and marginal contact balance. Allows angle blocks to slide out the side door too easily. When block gets off track, body control diminishes greatly. Below average redirect inside and recovery balance. Right-hand punch becomes predictable and can be countered for quick wins.", Round 5, Bobby Hart," Power-based guard who can generate movement off the ball, but lacks the balance and bend to be a consistent block sustainer. Smart defenders started to time up Mama's punch in pass protection, so he will need to vary his approach, but he does have the heavy hands and sturdy base to combat bull-rushers and set a shallow anchor. Could start his career as a backup, but has the size and ability to become eventual starter."
Isaiah McKenzie,WR," Specialized in hitting big plays. Scored a touchdown every seventh time he touched the football on offense this season and averaged 11.9 yards per offensive touch over three years at Georgia. Angular, downhill running still bolsters his home run kick return ability. Able to get instant acceleration off the line as a receiver or with the ball in his hands. Slippery in tight quarters, but will elude and go rather than trying to get miss after miss. Has vertical speed to win over the top of nickel cornerbacks on deep routes. Offers gadget touch option for creative offensive minds."," Diminutive frame. Arm tackles can end his run immediately. Has small hands and a minimal catch radius. Body catcher allows the ball to bang against his frame. Shows below average hand-eye coordination and overall concentration on deep throws. Contested catches are an issue for him. Routes lack sharpness expected from smaller, quicker wideout. Takes time to gather into his breaks and is slow to accelerate out of them. Able to uncover vertically much better than horizontally and struggles to uncover in short area. Production bolstered by jet sweeps and swing screens.", Round 6-7,," McKenzie's big play production is impressive on paper, but once you get into the tape, it becomes apparent that much of what he is able to accomplish is due to mismatched speed in space and packaged plays tailored towards his strengths. As a receiver, he is below the mark of what teams will expect from their slots in terms of route-running, but his explosive return ability could land him work right away."
Deon-Tay McManus,WR," Strong, muscular upper body. Plays to his size down the field. Understands how to shield defenders from the ball in space. Plays physically when ball is in the air. Leans on cornerbacks to generate some space advantage and uses well-timed leaps when making downfield catches. Has body control to adjust to underthrown balls and come down with the catch. Uses strong hands to secure contested catches. Shows an understanding of how to use leverage in his routes.", Burly hips with build of a running back more than a wide receiver. Gets into his routes with heavy feet. Could struggle to get past NFL press coverage. Lacks acceleration or speed for consistent route separation. Unable to get over the top of cornerbacks on vertical routes. One-note route runner with limited sink in route breaks. Disappointing blocker for his size. Want to see more determination to dominate when locked up as run blocker., UDFA,," Thickly built, physical wide receiver who might be growing into more of an H-back role due to his size. McManus runs a decent route and has an understanding of how to use his size to win contested catches, but he may lack the quickness to create enough separation to stick with an NFL team."
Al-Quadin Muhammad,DE," Angular build with a well proportioned frame and good muscular definition. Has experience playing 4-3 defensive end and as a 3-4 rush linebacker. Has some explosion in his hips and should test well in vertical leap and broad jump. Has adequate power in his base and can set a solid edge as an outside linebacker. Crashes down the line of scrimmage with wide, lateral steps to collide with heavy pads into runners trying to burst through running lanes. Possesses relatively forceful punch. Has a speed-to-power bullrush.", Highly inexperienced thanks to suspensions related to his disciplinary issues at Miami. Character red flags will be a concern headed into combine interviews. Tight hips restrict his stride length. Not a fluid athlete. Segmented movements feel labored. Sluggish change of direction to flow with the ball. Slight delay in his acceleration. Lacks man cover talent and is stiff dropping into space. Leggy at point of attack and can be washed away by size. Offers very little presence as edge rusher. Missing workable counter move. Loop under in twists is slow and telegraphed., PFA,," Muhammad has the physical traits to warrant a look even though he hasn't played football in two of the last three seasons. He's a basic pass rusher who doesn't have explosive burst upfield and he still has work to do with his hands. At this point, he's a developmental outside linebacker with character baggage that could have a heavy impact on his draft status."
Jonathan McLaughlin,OT, Dependable four-year starter who has played at a consistent level. Has long arms and utilizes his length for a generally well-timed punch. Able to mirror pass rushers with functional lateral slide and change of direction. Displays foot quickness to kick-slide out to meet pass rushers on the edge. Able to redirect weight back inside to catch up with sudden inside charges. Adequate athleticism to operate in zone scheme attack., Underdeveloped lower body with thin calves. Unbalanced pass sets feature way too much leaning. Punch tends to land a little high and wide allowing defenders to re-establish hands in his frame. Lacks strength to redirect defenders who get to his edge and struggles to maintain his arm extension. Gives away too much ground to bull rushers. Narrow base limits drive blocking success and block security on down blocks. Inconsistent getting up to his second level blocks. Waist-bending looks like a permanent issue., UDFA,, McLaughlin is a waist-bender from start of the rep to the end and his inability to play with better posture and balance looks like it will be challenging to correct. His athleticism is adequate but he appears to lack the strength and technique to work around his deficiencies.
Montae Nicholson,S," Height, weight and speed box checks across the board. Has a feel for route combinations and shades his coverage accordingly. Shows a willingness to trigger into anticipated passing lanes once he recognizes where pattern is headed. Long strider with some range over the top. Michigan State coaches expect him to test well in explosion drills. Takes few false steps and looks more comfortable in a Cover-2 shell.", Field toughness does not match his size. Ducks head into tackles and doesn't consistently square up his targets causing excessive missed tackles. Rarely imposes his will as a hitter. Leggy in coverage. Takes time to get hips and feet synced up when asked to mirror route breaks. Has had self-described confidence issues. Looks unsure of his responsibilities at times and will lose track of deep coverage. Just eight passes defensed over last two seasons which is a meager sum., PFA,," Nicholson has outstanding size and could test well at the combine and his pro day, but his tape is blah and no amount of workouts in shorts and t-shirts will change that. Nicholson's lack of playmaking production combined with his unsure tackling make him a traits-only prospect who could have a hard time sticking in the league unless he finds more confidence and aggression."
Leon McQuay III,S, Good athlete who is expected to test well. Build up runner with good makeup speed to close out targets who climb over the top. Possesses some cover talent from the slot and should be able to handle work coverage against matchup tight ends. Has big hands and quality ball skills at the catch point. Speed to range over the top. Consistent at raking catches out of receiver's hands when he's there for contested opportunities. Anticipates and diagnoses running plays well from deep safety positioning. Races downhill to a contain angle on sweep plays. Plays with quality closing burst to chase down running backs to the perimeter., Is a little slow to find his accelerator after opening hips to turn and run. Can be a victim of tunnel vision in coverage. Tape shows issues losing track of coverage responsibilities at times against play-action. Needs to play with better field balance from deep safety spot. Can be exploited by vertical concepts. Consistency as a tackler is an issue. Fails to come to balance at times will overrun the tackle. Needs to do a better job of wrapping up to prevent melting off of his tackle attempts., Round 7-PFA,," McQuay isn't an easy player to slot. He has the athleticism, ball skills and speed to play the high safety role, but his inconsistent field awareness is a concern. McQuay's issues with missed and broken tackles open concerns about playing him near the line of scrimmage. If he tests well, teams may see McQuay has a hybrid corner/safety who can compete for a spot as a big cover defender in sub-packages."
Speedy Noil,WR," Extremely explosive athlete. Was the NIKE SPARQ (Speed, Power, Agility, Reaction, Quickness) Rating national champion coming out of high school. Tough guy. Will take the best a hitter has to offer, bounce back up and run to the huddle. Good vertical speed to get over the top of slow-transitioning cornerbacks. Compact and powerful. Play strength is a plus. Has potential to be moved all over the field. Offers value as a dangerous kick returner."," Failed to live up to potential out of high school. Struggles to process and is limited in what coaches ask him to do. Poor ball tracking skills. When he wins vertically, that doesn't mean a catch is coming. Jack-of-many-trades but masters none. Route running is basic. Scouts lament his off-the-field character.", PFA,," The talent and athleticism alone is worth a higher grade, but the lack of production combined with character concerns inside the scouting community could make Noil a difficult sell until after the draft."
Fabian Moreau,CB," Former running back with a thick frame and great speed. Showed off his ability to jam and reroute receivers at Shrine Game practices. Patient from press. Fluid athlete with good lateral quickness and agility to press and match against plus athletes. Maintains good feel for the route as it progresses. Early accelerator with recovery quickness and ""makeup"" long speed. Good physicality inside the route. Shows enough reactive twitch to challenge slants. Uses size and speed to crowd vertical routes and fight off receivers' attempts to stack him on their hips. Showed noticeable improvement in confidence and coverage skills from 2014. Has upper body strength to stack and shuck most receivers. Break-down, wrap-up tackler with the build to challenge NFL runners with size.", Fairly limited in his coverages with focus on Cover-3 and press man. Lower body hits pause button giving up some separation when biting into head fake at top of the route. Takes time to gather and redirect when transitioning forward from bail coverage. Instincts and ball production have been marginal. Slow to recognize clearing routes and rarely ejects to overlap back into the play area. Paltry average of just one interception every 63 targets. Slow to find and track the deep throw. Has been tagged with an excessive amount of pass interferences and defensive holding penalties in college. Loses track of his man during scrambles., Round 2, Darqueze Dennard," Moreau is an explosive athlete who had to transition from running back over to cornerback. While the transition has taken some time thanks to inexperience and his 2015 injury, Moreau's tape shows a more confident and consistent cover man than before. Moreau's strength, speed and athleticism will move him up draft boards, but a torn pectoral muscle at his pro day could cause him to drop by a round."
Marcus Oliver,LB," Natural-born hitter. Plays with an aggressive nature and always takes the most physical path possible. Thumper between the tackles. Maintains eyes on the ball. Instincts are solid and will trigger quickly downhill. Lays into lead blocks or second-level climbers with a heavy shoulder than can jar the blocker. Has power in his hips and legs to grind past angle blocks and maintain his play balance. Productive two-year starter with a high number of his stops coming near line of scrimmage. Consistent in his pursuit. Considered a high-character person and hard worker in practice and in the weight room. Heads-up, chest first tackler lands with force. Forced five fumbles this season and 11 for his career.", Tight-hipped banger with heavy feet. Lacks the agility or twitch for stop-and-start pursuit. Slow to accelerate to the ball after changing direction. Below average body control in his pursuit. Lack of reactive athleticism leads to missed tackles in space. Play speed is below average and limits his range as a tackler. Downhill flow gets him caught up behind blockers. Is a huge liability in man coverage. Lacks the athletic ability to stick with his man through route breaks and allows crossing routes to uncover quickly., Round 7-PFA,," Oliver is an extremely physical interior thumper who plays his best football when allowed to play downhill and bring his pads into play. Unfortunately, Oliver is more segmented than fluid in his movement and his lack of play speed and acceleration will be a big issue when it comes to chasing down running backs headed for the perimeter. Oliver's lack of speed and ability to cover could force him into trying to earn a role as a backup inside linebacker for a 3-4 defense."
Samaje Perine,RB," Has build and toughness to handle a heavy workload if called on. Gets a deep press off line of scrimmage before making his cut. Able to fit into the crevices between the tackles and come out the other side. Very powerful through his hips and thighs. Creates for himself with power. Arm tacklers won't like the results. Drives through initial contact and continues to churn out additional yardage. Pad level is always where it is supposed to be. Delivers a message when he finishes runs. Short yardage winner and doesn't have much wasted motion as a runner. Decisive in his downhill charge but does so with quality vision. Not a typical third down option, but has the soft hands out of backfield to be a solid screen and check-down option."," All bully with very little ballerina as a runner. Lacks loose hips to make sudden lateral escapes or take advantage of a late opening. Doesn't have the big burst to jet from first to third level. Low-knee action keeps his lower body covered with hands and tackle attempts. Has prolonged gear-down to make open field cuts. Needs a clear path early in the rep. Missing restart quickness when slowed by initial defender. Play speed is very average. Could have troubles getting to the edge against NFL speed. Has had ankle injuries in past that could require additional scrutiny at the combine.

All bully with very little ballerina as a runner. Lacks loose hips to make sudden lateral escapes or take advantage of a late opening. Doesn't have the big burst to jet from first to third level. Low-knee action keeps his lower body covered with hands and tackle attempts. Has prolonged gear-down to make open field cuts. Needs a clear path early in the rep. Missing restart quickness when slowed by initial defender. Play speed is very average. Could have troubles getting to the edge against NFL speed. Has had ankle injuries in past that could require additional scrutiny at the combine.", Round 3, Michael Turner," Perine is a physical runner who can create additional yardage through power and can be a complimentary ""banger"" for a team who already has a slasher. Perine doesn't have the burst or play speed to be a dynamic lead back, but he can handle a heavy workload if needed and he should become an immediate short-yardage and goal-line option."
Devine Redding,RB," Patient runner who operates with desired tempo for zone scheme. Runs with wide eyes and good peripheral vision on stretch plays and sweeps. Responds quickly when cut-back lane begins to develop for him. Pace is good from first to second level. Has a feel for development of blocking in front of him and is able to make a sudden decision when necessary. Smooth in his reads from first to second level. Has subtle, efficient shifts in direction without gearing down when rolling downhill. Decisive runner with feet in a constant state of chop while probing for openings.", Could use more weight on his frame. Runs with hip tightness that strangles his ability to make sharp cuts and directional changes. Has tendency to roll into cuts which puts him into harm's way prematurely. Lacks memorable power at impact and will lose more battles than he wins when challenging with force. Has very few clean broken tackles over last two seasons. Leg drives and contact balance are inconsistent. Quicker than fast. May struggle to keep runs play-side and out-race the defense to the corner. Primarily a check-down and swing pass option in passing game., PFA, Alex Collins," Garden variety zone-scheme runner who has the decisiveness and vision to operate in that offense, but lacks the explosiveness, size and play strength to make a living as an NFL starter. Redding is more of a grinder than a special talent, and he'll likely just get what is blocked, but he's also capable enough to handle work in a zone scheme if called upon and should compete for the third running back spot."
Jalen Myrick,CB, Allowed a completion rate of just 39 percent over the last two seasons. Compact frame with quick hands. Able to mirror and punch out of press coverage to slow receivers from press release. Can run. Has the ability to carry long speed down the field or close out against receivers who get an early jump on him. Plays with good foot quickness for sudden stops from bump-and-run. Plays with plus balance in his coverage. Shows no hesitation when it is time to come up in run support. Has returned kicks for three seasons., Unable to maintain cushion from off-coverage due to tight backpedal. Needs to get better at balancing eyes between receiver and quarterback. Lacks pattern recognition and anticipation. Displays some stutter in his transition to close. Will opt to play the receiver at times rather than attacking the path to the ball. Below average hands gave away sure-fire interceptions this season. Ball skills down the field are below average. Allows receivers to generate too much separation through hand fighting and he can be late to turn and find the ball., Round 5,," He's undersized to play outside and will likely move inside to the slot. Myrick has enough foot quickness and athleticism to handle himself as a slot corner, but he's very average as a tackler and his ball skills and pattern recognition aren't where they need to be. He has enough ability to stick around as a backup for a little bit, but he will need to improve his anticipation to make a mark in the league."
Travis Rudolph,WR, Solid route runner. Sinks his hips into breaks and rarely gives his route intentions away with early head turn. Routes are run with good tempo and consistency. Glides into his routes with smooth acceleration. Disguises comeback routes effectively against man coverage. Opens quickly to the ball and plucks it away from his body. Has very natural hands with desired catch radius. Silky worker near the sidelines. Ball skills are good. Makes adjustments back to the ball on underthrown balls and picks up the ball quickly. His footwork is controlled and his body control and balance are on point. Had 14.3 percent of his catches this season go for 25-plus yards. More than willing to do his part as a run blocker and won't just try and shield cornerbacks away from the play.," May not have enough early juice out of his release to get a clean outside release against press corners. His stop-start acceleration is nothing special. Missing the short-area quickness to accelerate out of his breaks to uncover in tight spaces underneath. Works up to top speed quickly, but lacks a straight gas gear. Unable to access a big burst to run under the deep ball once he's open. Lacks a quality sales job on his double moves. Needs to improve play strength to help with contested catches on the next level. Average run-after-catch talent.", Round 5-6, Rashad Greene," Rudolph may not be a burner, but he consistently plays at his top speed and displays some polish in his route work. He doesn't have the explosive feet to uncover on shorter routes, but is more than capable of handling intermediate and some deep work. Rudolph will need to get stronger, but he's already a willing blocker in the run game which helps his cause. Could be an early backup who works himself into snaps fairly quickly."
Ricky Seals-Jones,WR, Has experience against quality defensive backs and linebackers in college. Enormous wide receiver who carries a tight end's frame. Has ability to get physical against smaller defensive backs after the catch. Good competitor with desired play strength through his routes. Could be utilized as matchup tight end on the next level. Functional blocker from the slot., Slow off the line of scrimmage and into his routes. Has no burst separation out of his breaks and is coverage magnet against man. Hands have been unforgiving his entire career. Double-digit drop rate for his career is disappointing. Non-factor in red-zone and unable to muscle up and win contested catches. Needed a year with his hand in the ground for transition to tight end., PFA,," Seals-Jones failed to live up to his ""five-star"" rating out of high school thanks to a lack of speed and separation quickness that was exposed in the speedy SEC. Separation on the next level will get even tougher and many teams see him as a tight end who may have to add weight and prove he can get after people as an in-line blocker to make an NFL roster."
Adam Pankey,OG," Has good thickness and functional mass in his calves, hips and bubble. Wide-body who is hard to get around. Has adequate lateral foot quickness in tight quarters. Has the feet to redirect inside against twists and stunts. Able to utilize his size to generate some early push. Has played both guard and tackle. Responsive to defensive line games up front. Plays with some natural anchor and holds up to bull rushers from interior.", Upright after the snap. Waist-bender with tightness in his knees. Doesn't have athletic ability to factor as a second-level blocker. Must do his work in the phone booth. Unable to consistently get to his blocks when working up. Struggles to mirror and center athletic defensive tackles in pass pro. Uses skip-pull footwork to get into his zone blocking steps. Hand placement is inconsistent and he fails to generate quality arm extension. Body control is below average., Round 6-7,," Pankey's girthy frame will appeal to teams looking for a beefy guard, but Pankey's lack of bend and leverage could cause some disappointment if teams are expecting his drive-blocking power to match his size. Pankey can handle basic zone blocks, but combinations and cut-off blocks are unlikely to land consistently enough to make him anything more than a back of the roster backup."
Adam Shaheen,TE," Enormous frame for a tight end. Powerfully built, well-proportioned frame. Accomplished high school hooper who brings the same footwork to the field. Has good sink into breaks and can make sharp cuts coming out. Has foot quickness for clever stutter-and-go double moves to uncover against linebackers. Above average speed and acceleration for his size. Creates leverage points against man coverage before breaking his routes off and pulling away. Moved all over the field. Was isolated for fade routes near endzone. Plus hand-eye coordination and shows ability to alter body positioning to improve catch-odds while ball-tracking.Trusted in pass protection. Sees twists and blitzes and responds to them. Needs work as run blocker but has desired frame of a Y-tight end.", Physically overwhelmed a lower level of competition. Upper body is stiff and mechanical in his routes. Hasn't learned how to utilize hands to free himself against press. Gets jammed up in his release and can be knocked off the timing of his patterns. Will need to learn to adjust in space in order to maneuver past traffic. In need of his fair share of technique work as a run blocker. Ducks head into initial contact. Finds himself lunging and chasing when asked to climb to second level.,, Vance McDonald," Big, fast and athletic, Shaheen will immediately interest teams who are looking for size and traits. He's a poorer blocker than what might be expected for a player with his frame, but he's also a much more dangerous pass catching target. The jump in competition will be substantial and teams will expect him to become a more consistent blocker, but he's a pass catching tight end in a Y-tight end's body. Shaheen has starting potential with an ability to impact a passing game early in his career."
David Sharpe,OT, Hulking wide-body with long arms that dangle beside his massive frame. Well proportioned with thick legs to match his upper body. Length can be debilitating for rushers if he lands first. Active with hands in pass pro and lands them inside defender's frame. Has enough anchor that bull-rushing him won't be much of an option. Uses his mass to overwhelm opponents and push them out of the play with his redirection. Big strong hands can clamp and ride defenders out of the play when he gets them framed up. Better pull blocker than might be expected. Decent straight-line movement carries him into striking position on the perimeter., Stiff as can be. Doesn't have flexibility in his ankles and knees to drop his pads to a functional level for leverage. Down blocks land way up the frame of his target and creates marginal block security. Waist-bender. Reaches for his targets with his upper body rather than his feet. Labored lateral movement just isn't quick enough. Unable to get across the face of defenders and doesn't have the upfield quickness to make cut-off blocks on linebackers. Lacks feet and body control needed to mirror and keep his blocks centered. One-and-done blocker who can't be counted on for combos., Rounds 2-3, Vadal Alexander, Massive tackle who will be forced to bump inside due to a lack of athletic ability to handle pass protection details. Sharpe does have enough size and length to get a team out of the game at tackle if injuries set in. Sharpe's lack of leverage and lateral agility limits what teams can ask of him and he needs to be in the right scheme for a chance at success as a starter.
Aarion Penton,CB, Considers himself a receiver when the ball is in the air. Highly reactive once he reads the break point. Attacks passing lane rather than receivers when he's got a bead on the route. Has hands to flip the field with interceptions or rake aggressively through the catch point if he wants to disrupt. Displays excellent timing when challenging high point throws. Pesky in man coverage and does everything he can to stay under the wide receiver's pads., Short and thin. Can be big-boyed against press coverage and knocked completely off-balance by powerful challenges. Make-up speed is below average. Allowed 20 yards per catch this season. Lacks fluidity in his transitions. Gives up massive swaths of open ground to shifty route runners. Unable to handle take-on tackle duties on a consistent basis. Could be consistently targeted by offenses in run game., Round 6-7,," Undersized ball-hawk with great ball skills but an inability to carry speed or quickness around the field when matched against it in man. Penton is extremely competitive when the ball is in the air, but the Senior Bowl practices exposed coverage issues against slot quickness as well as long speed. He will have to fight for a back-end roster spot."
Garrett Sickels,DE, Led the Big Ten with 43 quarterback pressures. Plays with shoulder turn approaching top of the rush arc. Looks to flip hips around the edge. Uses forward lean to generate momentum around corner and towards the quarterback. Decent athlete in space. Has lateral quickness to slide inside and attack the gap. Active hand fighter. Keeps playing to the whistle and will hustle into tackles down the field. Had one of his best performances of the season against the talented Ohio State offensive line., Lacks explosiveness to strike and disengage quickly. Gets glued to blocks for too long. Easily blocked in run game. Power at point of attack is below average. Lacks sand in his pants to drop anchor and own his grass against drive blockers. Gets pinned and sustained by tight ends. Finds himself on the ground too often. Needs to improve hands and angles to counter lack of play strength. Doesn't have long limbs to torque his way around tackles. Generates little speed-to-power., Round 7-PFA, Tyler Starr, Plays at the same pace throughout the game and finds his way into the backfield with a non-stop forward charge and some rush talent. Sickels' play strength at the point of attack is a big concern and he may be forced into an outside linebacker role in order to keep tackles off of him. Sickels projects as a backup who could eventually find the field in pass rush situations.
Jalen Robinette,WR, Outstanding NFL size with long arms and monster hands. Plays grown man football down the field. Able to leap and rise above the masses to pull down the deep ball. Physical and unfazed by contact. Plays with plus balance and body control when attacking the football. Has a knack for late separation down the field and plays with sharpened focus when ball is in the air. Showed off quick shake press release at Shrine practices. Has the raw size and tools that teams will covet., Missed out on catches outside his frame. Yards per catch totals bolstered by open opportunities in Air Force play-action game. Too tall into his routes robbing him of early acceleration. Overly-exaggerated head fakes into his brakes and stems don't fool anyone. Route-running is very raw and will need time to be developed. Needs to play faster when setting up routes underneath. Pattern matchers could eat him up early on. Can be slow to get head around and find the football. Doesn't go looking for contact as run blocker., Round 6-7, Cody Latimer," Robinette has impressive size and vertical ball skills, but his route-running is extremely raw due to the limitations of Air Force's option-based attack. Like others before him from similar offenses, Robinette is a traits-based prospect with a high ceiling, but he could need a redshirt year to become comfortable with the route requirements of a pro-style attack."
JuJu Smith-Schuster,WR," Outstanding size and a very available target. Shows no concern working over the middle. Known for his competitive spirit and alpha demeanor. Hyper-aware of defenders around him in space. Works back to the ball as aggressively as he needs to when defenders are attempting to ball-hawk. Searches and sinks into the optimal openings against zone coverage. Plays to his size and has plus route strength. Shows effective uses of frame to shield cornerbacks from contested catches. Plucks it way out front of his body with strong, confident hands. Tremendous ball tracker with ability to search, find and follow the pass in over his shoulder. Has body control to twist and contort in mid-air to pull the throw in. Plays with sideline awareness and consistently drops feet in-bounds on boundary catches. Rugged, aggressive runner after the catch with a stiff-arm to hurt feelings.. Has field vision after catch for maximum YAC yardage. Reliable blocker who can help spring a big run. Able to sustain blocks with power.", Needs to get better at freeing himself at the break point of his routes. Doesn't seem to get cornerbacks tilting with his routes. Missing the sudden acceleration out of his cuts to generate separation and an easy throwing window. Contested catches will have to be a big part of his future. Rarely shows a second gear to run under the deep throws. Will coast when turning to find deep ball rather than maintaining play speed. Off-man corners may squat on underneath routes if they don't fear his vertical speed. Can be slow to release against press coverage. Plays with a delayed open to the quarterback on his comeback routes. Will need to pay better attention to his angles as a blocker. Eight of his ten touchdowns this season came in three games., Round 2, Anquan Boldin," Smith-Schuster will get dinged for his lack of speed and separation but he reminds me of Anquan Boldin with his strong hands, physical approach and ability to win the combat catches. JuJu is missing some of the speed traits teams want from their WR1, but he could become a high-volume, possession target with the size tto win some 50/50 throws down the field. Teams who have a speed merchant at one spot would be wise to take a look at Smith-Schuster as a physical counterpart."
ArDarius Stewart,WR," Brings a physical play demeanor to the field at all times. Has takeoff to push cornerbacks into an aggressive backpedal. Karate fighting hands ward off jams and redirect attempts inside his route. Varies route speed to create uneasiness in defender. Sells route fakes with sharp head turns that tilt cornerbacks. Has a gas gear to race past defender and climb quickly over the top. Talented ball tracker with skills to win the deep ball on a consistent basis when matched one on one. Body control for mid-air adjustments is superb and his hands are like clamps. Very strong player and can take the ball away from corners when he needs to. Has kick return talent that translates into the NFL. Competitive runner after catch with skills that mirror a running back. Will elude certain tacklers and punish others. When asked to block and sustain, he's willing to do his part."," Burly through the hips and doesn't have the build of the typical receiver. Saw 70 percent of his yardage gained come after the catch. Benefited from screens, pop passes and reverses. Routes could use more sharpness at his break points. Wasn't asked to create route separation on short and intermediate routes very often. Will need to work aggressively back to the ball as a pro. Can you get too cute with the ball in his hands and run himself out of yardage. There is still room for improvement with his hands.", Rounds 2-3, Chris Hogan," Alabama-tough and plays the game like a grown man. Stewart is an extremely competitive target who has been a catch-and-run option as well as a deep ball threat, but he has the tools to become a solid starter who can be effective in all areas of the field. While Stewart could come in and compete for early kick return duties, some teams may view his run after the catch skills as his true value-added talent."
Weston Steelhammer,S," Utilizes decent backpedal in his coverage and has adequate hip smoothness to transition with route breaks. In man-off coverage, plays the quarterback rather than the receiver. Instinctive with outstanding anticipatory skills. Keys on quarterback's eyes and upper body movement creating optimal response time to play the pass. Ball skills are primo. Always looks to play ahead of the route and take a playmaker's path to the ball. Believes the ball is his. Finished with 18 career interceptions. Triggers quickly when allowed to play downhill. Downhill, physical mindset as a tackler. Form tackler who always sees what he hits.", Undersized safety with skinny arms. Below NFL weight standards. Can be taken for a ride by lead blockers on perimeter of the line of scrimmage. Needs more weight work. Has to do a better job of taking on blocks. Has short arms and small hands. Missing twitch and acceleration to stay with receivers out of break points. Tries to cheat his lack of speed and quickness with guesses. Desire to make plays will cause cover busts at times. Double moves are his nemesis. Lacks range over the top and can ill-afford a false step when tasked with deep coverage., PFA,," Three-year starter with an impressive nose for the ball, but a lack of NFL-caliber speed and size. Steelhammer's ball production is hard to ignore as is his ability to anticipate routes and play one step ahead. However, he lacks reactive athleticism to make up for some of the guess work he will do in coverage. If he can prove to be a quality cover man on special teams and carve out a role as a sub-package cover talent, then he could find himself on a roster within the next couple of years."
Orion Stewart,S, Could still grow into his frame with more natural addition of muscle. Possesses long arms and big hands and plus ball skills. Reliable hands will bring interceptions home when he gets his shots. Comes downhill to attack run fit before running lane explodes. Gobbled up tackles as a special teamer his first two seasons at Baylor and might be able to respond quickly in the same capacity as a pro., Way too stiff in the hips for functional direction change. Unable to generate the hip flip and acceleration to make up for early missteps. Lacks the play speed and overall range to handle duties as single-high safety. Allowed excessive number of touchdowns due to his stiffness and below average recovery skills. Anticipation is below average. Slow to find the football in deep coverage. Was benched at one point this season. Scouts concerned about his character., UDFA,," While there are some physical traits that could be appealing to teams and he has produced some ball production, he is lacking in the fluidity and speed needed for the position and he's not enough of a banger to make a living in the box. Stewart is likely to get his shot in camp via the free agency route."
Jack Tocho,CB," Compact frame with good play strength. Highly intelligent and will be able to digest an NFL playbook easily. Known for work ethic on and off the field. Veteran cornerback who understands his own strengths and weaknesses. Plays with confidence. Has good field awareness from bail coverage and shows good pattern recognition. Limited false steps when transitioning to the throw. Has played both sides of the field and has experience in press, off and zone.", Average athlete with below average lateral agility. Fears long speed and will bolster his cushion against certain opponents. Short-strider lacking make-up speed when beaten over the top. His jam can be slow and telegraphed giving receivers a chance to scoot by quickly. A little bumpy in his backpedal. Is slow to turn and find the ball with his back to the quarterback. Needs to come downhill stronger in run support. Stays glued to blocks for too long., PFA,," Tocho has good size and is an experienced press corner with a decent closing burst to the ball, but an inability to carry speed down the field could limit his scheme fits. The football intelligence and instincts are good enough but he has to prove he can run."
Damarius Travis,S," Physical player with good size and the desired play demeanor for the position. Force player who will always opt for the more violent strikes. High character player and person. Considered coachable and dependable. Displayed versatility in Gopher defense. Lined up as a box safety, high safety and on the slot. Has box safety instincts against the run. Takes efficient paths to the perimeter from down low. Plays with a spirited effort. Shows ability to handle coverage duties on tight ends. Instincts are solid. Responds quickly to quarterback's intentions. Outstanding special teams talent who can help right now. Finished with 17 special teams tackles during his first two seasons at Minnesota.", Can get a little loose in his pursuit angle headed downhill giving away some leverage against backside cuts. Has tightness in his hips. Sluggish lateral quickness. Has to gear down and take a more rounded path to the ball. Slow to open hips in his transitions. Range and long speed appear to be below average. Could struggle to maintain coverage responsibilities in vast space. Still room for improvement with tackling technique. Comes in hot rather than coming to balance before striking. Needs to eliminate some of the head-first approaches and look to square up his open field targets., Round 7-PFA,," Travis is a box safety who has the size and play demeanor to handle the rigors of the position, but will need to improve the consistency of his tackling. Travis may have enough cover skills to match up against in-line tight ends and handle zone responsibilities, but routes that force him to handle coverage down the field could become a challenge. Travis' size and special teams potential gives him a roster advantage over some of the other, later Day 3 safeties in this draft."
Stanley Williams,RB, Sports tremendous burst to the edge. Has the acceleration ability to run with extended patience on outside zone plays. Heels barely touch the ground during his runs and he has lateral agility to make wide cuts to avoid tacklers. Able to rip through a crease when he sees it. Combination of speed and elusiveness makes him a nemesis in space. Has some value on slip screens. May offer some kick return value., Undersized for anything other than a change-of-pace role. Not a very tough runner when tasked with work between the tackles. Runs come crashing to a halt when he senses contact on interior. Unable to break tackles or generate much yardage after contact. Way too hesitant when on downhill runs. Tends to dance and look for large point of entry rather than trusting his blockers. Vision is very average. Drops and fumbles are an issue., PFA,," Scat back with outstanding burst who can create for himself in space, but is not about that life when asked to run between the tackles. Williams doesn't have the blocking or the hands to be a full-time third-down back and he lacks the decisiveness and vision necessary to handle snaps as a backup. While he does have plus athletic ability, Williams may be too limited in what he can offer a team from a roster flexibility standpoint."
Ahkello Witherspoon,CB," Exceptional combination of size and speed. Hips are fluid and feet are fast. Opens hips and gets to top speed quickly with long, easy strides to chase receivers down the field. Plus athleticism allows for quick recovery when beaten early off release. Showed marked improvement in his instincts and overall feel for coverage. Is beginning to recognize patterns and play ahead of the routes. Played multiple sports growing up including baseball which helped sharpen hand-eye coordination and ball skills. Takes playmaking angles to the ball and defends the catch point with tremendous timing. His 2016 completion percentage against was just 26.5. Tied for second in nation in passes defensed with 20. Was a long time soccer player and has the foot quickness to mirror match receivers."," Has a gangly frame that is all arms and legs. Will have to add more functional strength to compete against NFL physicality. Keeps weight too far back in his backpedal. Technique somewhat raw and still needs refining. For all his ball skills, ended up with just three interceptions in 143 targets. Had some balance and footwork issues when matching receivers through route breaks. Tape of his run support is not for the weak. Almost always in a state of retreat when run heads his way. Unwilling to step downhill and stick his nose in to help contain the edge. Passivity against the run cost his team two touchdowns against Michigan.", Rounds 2-3, Patrick Robinson," Possesses a rare combination of size and speed and saw his ball production take a substantial leap this season. Witherspoon played just one season of high school football so his technique and route awareness should continue to improve. Witherspoon's length and his ability to mirror and match in space should launch him into early playing time, but his unwillingness to tackle and hit will be a complete turn-off for some teams."
Howard Wilson,CB, Took the ball away in high school and continued to do it in college. Averaged an interception (nine total) every 15 targets despite just one season as a full-time starter. Drapes his length over throwing windows. Has impressive burst to ball that brings him into range to make plays on the throw. Has the size and speed to stay with burners down the field. Springy leaper with catch radius to ruin the 50/50 tries. Always monitoring quarterback from off-man and zone. Will take a direct line to the ball when he decides to trigger. Has the hips and feet to mirror and match all over the field. Well-coached and experienced in a variety of techniques. Shows no fear when it's time to come get ball carriers as a tackler. Goes low and goes hard., Has very limited experience relative to the rest of the cornerbacks in this draft. Missed most of 2015 with an ACL tear that teams will look into at the combine. Will require additional time to hone his pattern recognition and instincts down the field. Has a very thin frame with skinny legs. Lacks desired muscular definition and needs a full year of work in an NFL weight program to pack on necessary muscle. Plays a little too upright at times. Scouts believe he could struggle early inside a complicated defensive scheme., Rounds 5-6, Jeremy Lane," Smooth athlete with excellent length who has a long history of making plays on the football. Wilson is fast and fluid and he's willing to do his part as a tackler, but he needs more muscle and more experience before he's ready to handle some of the physical receivers he will see in the league. Wilson's size, speed and ball skills will be coveted traits and they give him a chance to become a good NFL starter with time."
Xavier Woods,S," Ball skills are a plus. From high safety, tracks the ball the moment it comes out of quarterback's hands. Understands when he can undercut routes and has sticky hands to bring the ball in. Plays with above average instincts that have him primed to swoop into a passing lane. Drives hard on the route as soon as quarterback begins windup. Considers the ball his birthright. Always looking to make a play and is often successful. Has ridiculous ball production over last three seasons with fourteen interceptions and five forced fumbles. Can bring the wood as a hitter and has talent for timing hit to jar the ball loose from receivers. Good tackle production despite being moved around the field.", Size is a little below average for the position. Better hitter than tackler. Needs to fine-tune tackle fundamentals to eliminate misses in space. Slow to change direction. Lacks reactive athleticism and quickness for desired recovery ability. Backpedal is upright and little rigid. Tightness through his hips limits stride length and agility in space. Can be slow to range from the hash to the boundary against deep ball unless he gets a head-start. Will bust coverage looking to make a play. Gets caught guessing and can be manipulated and moved by quarterback glances. Will have to learn to play with better discipline., Rounds 5-6,," Woods' career stat sheet at Louisiana Tech is loaded with play after play, but that has to be balanced out with his occasional lack of discipline that can cost his defense on the back end. Woods has outstanding instincts and ball skills, but will need to play with the game in front of him due to potential athletic limitations in space. Woods is a tough competitor and his penchant for finding the ball is likely to win a team over in the later rounds."
Joe Yearby,RB," Plays at a fast pace and can process run lane development quickly. Has light, bounding feet that allow him to probe along the offensive line and dart in and out of would-be run lanes. Features a good burst to the edge to race around the corner. Uses effective spin move to maneuver out of tackles. Plays with above average contact balance and will fight for additional yardage. Has one-cut quickness when he sees his path. Elusive runner with shake in tight quarters. Can make defenders miss on first and second levels and strings runs together. Has just one career fumble in 393 attempts.", Lost almost half of his carries this season to a more talented sophomore running back. Squatty build can carry additional body fat if he's not diligent in workouts. Short-stepper who is more quick than fast. Is usually walked down from behind in open field. Tight-hipped and runs with a fairly narrow base. Runs hard but isn't much of a tackle breaker. Plays so fast that his patience can be an issue. Below average success rate in short yardage situations., Round 7-PFA,," Yearby has decent size and very good quickness, but lacks power and many scouts see him as a backup running back with some third down potential. Yearby has average vision and is able to react quickly to what is in front of him. Yearby's quickness to the perimeter combined with his quick cuts and elusiveness make him an interesting change-of-pace runner who could surprise on the next level if given a chance."
Ishmael Zamora,WR, Impressive overall size and frame. Massive target who might be able to mismatch smaller cornerbacks in the NFL. Size/speed prospect with build-up acceleration to climb over cornerbacks. Possesses untapped potential. Limiting Baylor offense didn't ask as much from him as he has to offer. Plus athletic ability for a receiver his size. Former high school track star with desired hip flexibility and leaping ability. Flashes separation juice out of his route stems. Ball tracking is adequate. Plays to his size after the catch and can be a punishing runner while banging through tackle attempts for additional yardage.," Much too reliant upon size and athleticism over route acumen. Limited route work. Baylor offense prevented him from getting much experience on intermediate level. Hands lie to him. Will drop some easy ones. Catch attempts lack focus when forced to extend outside his frame. Inconsistent pass catcher in traffic and will drift on in-breaking routes. Needs to learn how to best utilize his frame to shield defenders from catch attempts. Effort and desire as a run blocker can be very disappointing. Was not invited to the Combine due to character concerns. Suspended for three games by Baylor, charged with misdemeanor and given 40 hours of community service after video surfaced of him stomping on and whipping his dog with a belt.", Rounds 5-6, Moritz Boehringer," Classic triangle numbers (height, weight, speed) prospect with the combination of physical and athletic traits demand immediate attention from evaluators. Zamora is raw (relative to what NFL will ask from him) coming out of Baylor's offense and his lack of desired game experience could add to his learning curve. Zamora's hands and effort as a blocker must both improve or he will be just another tall, big, fast receiver who didn't make it."
Alex Anzalone,LB, Has desired size and athleticism to fit into any defensive scheme. His fluid hips allow for easy flips and turns in space. Wide open strider with plus range. Makes up plenty of ground to the perimeter when looking to reel in running backs. Plays with gap-to-gap lateral quickness in his shuffle. Races downhill to get a taste of what iso blockers are serving up. Three-down linebacker who showed off the speed to carry running backs down the field in coverage. Has experience playing all three linebacker spots. Squeezes routes from zone and has acceleration to match seam-running tight-ends. Has closing burst and enough wiggle to challenge the pocket as a blitzer.," Has had substantial injuries in his background that helped limit his playing time and production. Has no interceptions or forced fumbles at Florida. Plays with inconsistent base. Contact balance is very average. Needs to improve with taking on pulling guards and cross blocking H-backs. Disengagement takes too long and he expends too much energy. Needs to punch and move to avoid being engulfed by linemen. Gets moved out of his run fits by misdirection. Overreacts to play fakes and will lose sight of the ball. At times, will look to do too much in coverage rather than just manning his position.", Rounds 2-3, Vincent Ray," Anzalone's size, speed and athleticism will be tempting for teams looking for a linebacker who can play all three spots. However, concerns about his durability could cause some teams to shy away from him on the first two days of the draft. If he can stay healthy, he has the talent to become a solid three-down starter in the league."
Toby Baker,P, Has good size for the position. Had a 50-plus yard punt in 10 of the 11 games he kicked in this season. Had 36.8 percent of his total punts this year go 50 yards or more. Forced a fair catch rate of 42.1 percent and has not had a punt blocked over the last two seasons. Lauded for his mental toughness and attention to details by the coaching staff., Has a low percentage of punts inside the opponent's 10-yard line over last two seasons. Will need to expedite his snap-to-punt time as it is a little below the NFL average. Hang time can use improvement., PFA,," Baker has enough leg strength to give him a shot to earn an NFL roster spot, but he will have to improve his directional kicking and accuracy on touch punts to be considered the total package."
Tarell Basham,DE," Possesses an NFL-ready build including long arms and big, strong hands. Shows flashes of explosive twitch in his attack upfield. Able to dislodge a tackle's anchor with his speed-to-power move. Has upper body power and traits to become better at softening the edge as a rusher. Plays with good short area burst to close out running backs and scrambling quarterbacks. Maintains functional motor to keep looking for tackles outside of his general area. Asked to drop into space at times and showed enough athletic ability to handle it. Roughneck who likes to take it to tackles and tight ends as edge-setter. Gives physical redirect of tight ends getting into routes.", Plays with tightness in his hips which restricts his bend and pad level. Straight-line attacker who will roll past his target if he doesn't gather his weight early. His pass rush attack is still basic. Leaves his hands at home rather than turning them into weapons of victory. Tries to bull his way around the edge with strong lower body rather than softening edge with his hands. Needs to develop a better plan with reliable counters to beat pro tackles. Lacks smoothness in his turn around the corner. Can still get more out of his long arms., Round 3,," Basham has the strength and length to play as a 4-3 base end or as a 3-4 rush linebacker, but his pass rush approach will need to be sharpened as he lacks the flexibility to bend the edge and attack the pocket with athleticism alone. Basham may never produce a high sack total, but his alpha playing style will appeal to teams looking to groom a solid backup with starter's potential."
Tyus Bowser,OLB," Explosive, quick-twitch athlete. Bursts out of his stance and challenges the edge. Good shoulder turn at the edge of rush and can dip and corner with very tight radius. Showed ability to play in variety of spots. Crisp change of direction ability. Took to his coaching and showed drastic improvement against the run this year. Played two years of college basketball at Houston which shows up with his footwork and fluidity when dropping into space. Has ability to pattern match tight ends. Light is starting to come on for him. Should have a big day at the combine.", Undersized on the edge. May not have the frame to carry much more weight. Can be engulfed by size. Needs to get better with hands at point of attack. Still has issues where he looks like a basketball guy learning football. Production as pass rusher doesn't match his explosive traits. Pass rush is built around athleticism and not enough around skill. Has to get even tougher and more skilled against the run., Round 1-2, Eli Harold," Ascending pass-rush prospect who is still learning the fundamentals of his position thanks to a late commitment to the sport. Bowser's movement ability in space creates interesting possibilities for teams looking for a twitched-up toy to play with. Bowser lacks production, but his explosive characteristics off the edge will push him up the draft board and give him a chance to play well above where some scouts might project him."
Joshua Dobbs,QB, Has the ball handling and release quickness to get the ball out early when challenged by sudden pressure. Able to get through progressions to the check down option. Throws a tight spiral with adequate drive velocity. Eye-catching deep pass accuracy (47.7  completion percentage) with 14 touchdowns on throws 21-plus yards. Displayed good mental toughness. Can make timely exits from the pocket and win with his feet against overzealous rushers who vacate their rush lanes. Has explosive ability as a runner. Offers a team packaged-play potential in short yardage situations., Could use more weight on his frame. Below average delivery balance affects his accuracy and ball placement. Footwork is uneven and causes him to throw from unbalanced platform too often. Throwing motion causes him to push some throws. Floats the deep out allowing defenders to close out his passing windows. Decision making not where he needs it to be. Can't always get away from poor looks once he's made his mind up pre-snap. Threw nine interceptions on just 104 attempts beyond 10 yards this season., Round 3,," Dobbs is hardly incompetent as a passer, but he hasn't shown as much growth with his ball placement and accuracy as scouts had hoped to see from this former four-star prospect. Dobbs has decent size and is an outstanding runner outside the pocket which could appeal to a team looking for a developmental quarterback with play-making ability."
Rasul Douglas,CB," Tall, sporting an angular frame with good overall length. Very aware from zone coverage. Will roll out of his coverage area and overlap in order to make a play. Reads quarterbacks drops and will break early to race ahead of slants and make a play on the throw. Finisher when the ball is there to be had and flashed ball skills of a pro. Plays with strong hands. Able to go up high and win the 50-50 balls and needs very little time to have hands interception-ready. Good recognition of route combinations and will shift from pattern to pattern. Not a physical tackler but gets guys down. Length allows him to catch stray running backs breaking contain."," Tall corner who plays upright in his pedal, which affects his balance and transition quickness. Very average in his pattern matching and has below average closing burst to the ball. Won't be able to match quick-footed receivers from press coverage. Athletic and coverage limitations could limit his scheme fits. Doesn't have the downfield juice to stick with burners on go routes. Makeup speed is below average. Inconsistent hitter who may lack necessary aggressiveness as tackler to project to safety. Defaults to arm tackles.", Round 3, Daryl Worley," Douglas has rare size for the position and his 2016 interception total will add to the level of intrigue for NFL teams. There is no doubting Douglas' ability to make plays on the ball when he's in position, but his lack of long speed and closing burst could make his big senior season an anomaly. Douglas is a zone corner with press and trail ability but needs to run a reasonable time at the combine to solidify his draft slotting."
Jessamen Dunker,G, Good athlete with few physical limitations in space. Has the feet to reach challenging blocks with more technique work. Able to get to cut-off blocks. Has adequate connection rate on linebackers and box safeties. Arm length and hand size is a plus. Plays with a wide base in his pass sets. Has ability to slide from gap to gap to handle quickness requirements against twists and blitzes.," Play strength doesn't match his weight. Was unable to anchor against speed-to-power as a tackle. When defenders stab his chest, he is unlikely to reset hands and recover. Has issues over-setting at both guard and tackle. Guard-only prospect. Plays way out over his toes in run game and falls off of blocks. Feet move as drive blocker, but there isn't much push behind them. Can be rag-dolled at point of attack by power.", Rounds 6-7,," Dunker is an excellent athlete, but he is extremely raw and may not have enough core strength to consistently hold up against NFL power. His best chance is with a zone-oriented rushing team, but he will still need time to improve his technique and strength before he could become a factor on the depth chart."
Travin Dural,WR, Good size with great play speed. Has wheels to challenge cornerbacks up and over the top if they start to sit on his routes. Has the feet to jab and juke into the clear against press with more coaching. Early accelerator into his routes with desired forward lean. Doesn't need extended runway to hit top speed. Plus athlete with the wiggle and speed to turn crossing routes into chunk plays. Plays with some grit after the catch when challenging tacklers. Much more talented than his production would indicate. Possesses adequate toughness. Efficient hand fighter who is able to adjust routes against contact. Always plays up to his natural speed. Gives reliable effort as blocker and has the size to widen the contain of smaller corners.," Small hands measured less than 9 inches last spring. Suffers from occasional focus drops. Finished with just one catch of 20-plus yards. Lack of production could bother scouts despite poor quarterback play. Never reached the 40 catch mark in any of his seasons at LSU. Has long speed, but below-average ball skills to capitalize. Tracking and gauging the deep ball is a challenge. Allows defenders room to play the ball rather than stacking and controlling them on his hip. Routes powered by speed over precision. Inconsistent when asked to make combat catches.", Rounds 5-6, Arrelious Benn," Dural has the size and athletic traits that could push his draft value well beyond his college production that was hindered by a flailing offense that never found a capable quarterback. While he has legitimate pro talent and deep speed, his average ball skills and body positioning make him a ""high ceiling, low floor"" option at wideout."
Corn Elder,CB, Doesn't realize he's undersized. Plays physically and with good confidence. Patient from press with footwork and body control for extended mirroring of release. Gets into receivers and can take their route off-schedule. Sinks into receivers on outside release constricting the vertical throwing window. Plays variety of coverages and squeezes routes in all. Former high school basketball star with point guard quickness and little hesitation in his transitions. Twitchy click-and-close to the ball. Plus instincts and ready to pounce on throws from zone. Aggressive in run support striking through his target and running his feet through completion. Doesn't realize he's undersized. Plays physically and with good confidence. Patient from press with footwork and body control for extended mirroring of release. Gets into receivers and can take their route off-schedule. Sinks into receivers on outside release constricting the vertical throwing window. Plays variety of coverages and squeezes routes in all. Former high school basketball star with point guard quickness and little hesitation in his transitions. Twitchy click-and-close to the ball. Plus instincts and ready to pounce on throws from zone. Aggressive in run support striking through his target and running his feet through completion.," Will be too small to play outside in the pros. Lightweight and will get ""big-boyed"" by bigger slots who play with good route strength. Quicker than fast. Lacking a second gear and will give up some separation on intermediate and deep routes. Has issues defending the high throw. Tall receivers can go up and over him. Physical nature could create durability concerns if pressed into extensive run-support situations.", Rounds 4-5, Tavon Young," Elder has the three Cs - composure, confidence and competitiveness. Elder has the instincts and reactive quickness to find his way to the football and his ability to mirror and match gives him a chance to handle slot duties in the NFL. Elder's most challenging opponent this offseason will probably be the combine scale. Elder's lack of size could hurt his draft stock, but his talent and toughness is NFL-worthy."
Jake Elliott,K, Very quick leg action on his follow-through. Kicks with excellent trajectory. Doesn't allow an early miss to wreck his confidence. Has had three of six onside kicks recovered including all three attempts over last two seasons. Had just one kick blocked over four years. Never allowed a kickoff return for a touchdown. Simply never misses chip shot kicks making every attempt inside of 30 yards for his career., Kickoff distance and hang-time are below desired NFL marks. Will need to add more distance to his kickoffs as a pro. Has a smallish frame and could have issues as a last line of defense on kickoffs. Has had issues hitting mid-range field goals with consistency. Initial jab step into approach is a little slow., Round 7-PFA,," Elliott's lack of consistent leg strength and hang time on kickoffs could hurt his chances, but he's been a lights-out kicker for his career with the exception of a dreadful sophomore season. Elliott is a consistent ball striker with a repeatable follow-through who has proven to have the necessary range for teams looking for a consistent kicker beyond 50 yards."
Amba Etta-Tawo,WR," Above average height, weight and speed. His routes got sharper and hands got stickier as the season progressed. Developed some explosiveness out of his stems and in his in-breaking routes. Has acceleration to create adequate separation on all levels. Flashes quick-release potential in his feet against press corners. Builds up to top speed and races past unsuspecting cornerbacks if they don't open to run early. Finds the deep ball quickly and will body up to create late separation for the catch. Impressive down-gear from sprint to stop with comeback routes can shake tight man coverage. Plucks the throw way out in front of his body and has catch radius to snag throws outside his frame in all directions. Tucks throws away despite collisions at catch-point.", Only one year of college production. Tagged with nine drops to his 30 catches in his second and third seasons. Will telegraph his comeback routes a little. Still very raw with his route running and wasn't asked to run much of the tree. High number of catches came via wide receiver screens and comebacks against off coverage. Numbers bolstered by system that can pull safeties out of the equation in his vertical routes. Had about a zillion drops at the Senior Bowl and looked out of his element. Struggled to shake press coverage during one-on-one drills., Rounds 6-7, Chris Conley," While he's obviously still raw, the tape shows an improving talent with an ability to challenge over the top and uncover underneath. Unfortunately for Etta-Tawo, he was wildly inconsistent and his hands were exposed as a flawed part of his game once again. He's a vertical receiver who has the potential to become more than that with additional work, but he looks like a developmental backup at this point."
Rudy Ford,S, Compact frame carries some pop as a tackler. Comes downhill ready to put in work. Maintains run fits and leverages running backs to the sideline. Aggressive hitter who hits with his head up and looks to run through his target. Consistently productive tackler who is an efficient finisher. Has decent hands and can take the ball away if it is there for him. Plays safety and handled man coverage as a nickel this season. Has kick return and coverage experience on special teams., Plays with tightness in his hips. Is slow to open and transition in coverage. Gives up too much separation out of breaks to be counted on in full-time man cover situations. Straight-liner who can be slow to sink and change directions in space as a tackler. Lacks the length to slide around open field blockers quickly. Route anticipation and instincts are just average. Production on the ball is below average., Round 6-7,," Ford has been a solid starter and productive tackler as a three-year starter in the SEC, but his tight hips and lack of instant acceleration could limit what teams are able to ask from him in coverage. He will likely have to add some weight and try to prove himself as a backup box safety who can make plays on special teams."
Nate Gerry,S," Chiseled from granite. Controlled, downhill shuffle from the box to mirror running back. Plays with advanced instincts against both run and pass. Anticipates patterns and can play ahead of receiver's breaks. Will not hesitate to fire into the passing lane. Has soft hands with plus ball skills leading to thirteen career interceptions. Races into his run support work. Can adjust his run fits according to flow of the play. Decisive when triggering downhill from high safety position. Takes smart angles to the ball with a good feel for speed vs. space. Looks to make tackles near line of scrimmage. Played combo safety role and has experience with slot coverage."," Plays with tightness in his lower half. Linear attacker with need for excessive gear-down to redirect his weight. Restricted strider with limited play range. Missed excessive amount of tackles over last two seasons. Lacks desired agility and change of direction in tight quarters to secure shifty runners. Slow to flip hips and accelerate down the field. Lacks speed, range and length to play single-high safety on pro level. Susceptible to separation when asked to work from backpedal.", PFA, Shiloh Keo," Rocked-up strong safety type who can play near the line of scrimmage and operate in zone coverage. Gerry's lack of reactive agility will limit him in man coverage and create inconsistencies as a tackler, but he's very instinctive and will get to more plays than he should. Gerry has the urgent play demeanor needed to become a consistent contributor on special teams and fit into a fourth or fifth safety spot."
Eddie Jackson,S," Has solid athleticism for the safety spot. Not a speed merchant but has the instincts and range to play over the top. Gets secondary lined up. Can cover tight ends and the occasional slot receiver. Former cornerback who played wide receiver in high school. Has the tracking, timing and hands to take the ball away when he gets his shot. Offers roster versatility. Returned two punts for touchdowns this season and has three career defensive touchdowns. Background as a returner makes him more dangerous than your average safety after an interception."," Long, but lanky and not built for a physical pounding. Grab and drag tackler. Will do what he has to against the run, but he's not going to be a tone-setter with his hitting. Dominant defensive front made his job in coverage much easier. Had some easy, no-brainer interceptions float his way on overthrows. Can get too cute trying to stay glued to the quarterback's eyes rather than triggering towards his boundary help over the top. Will occasionally lose track of his deep ball responsibility. Has had two major injuries in his career that will draw plenty of attention at the combine.", Round 4-5,," Former cornerback-turned-safety with decent instincts and good ball skills but a finesse mentality as a tackler relative to those around him. Jackson's background in man coverage and his ability to return punts should create some additional value for him, but he'll be pressed into much more difficult situations in the league. Jackson is an average NFL backup with immediate punt return possibilities."
Keith Kelsey,LB," Productive tackler for all three years as a starter at Louisville. Prefers to play the game downhill looking to attack near the line of scrimmage. Will not stop pursuing the football until he hears the whistle blow. Has desired aggressiveness for interior linebacker spot. Body up, wrap 'em up tackler. Stat sheet filled with hustle plays including three forced fumbles this season and 10.5 career sacks.", Not a very fluid athlete. Slow to transition in his change of direction and is likely to have issues making the open field tackle on the next level. Play speed is below average. Will have problems effectively chasing runners headed to the perimeter. Tape filled with diving tackle attempts that are likely to turn into misses against better competition. Instincts are below average and it can take him time to find the ball., UDFA,," Kelsey has decent size, but he is lacking in the necessary functional speed and athleticism teams look for in draftable linebackers. He is a two-down linebacker who lacks the man-cover talent to play on third downs in the league and his best hope may be to land on a practice squad. Becoming a special teams ace might have to be Kelsey's door into the league."
Zane Gonzalez,K, Has a powerful lower body and gets good trajectory on long-distance kicks. Has continued to add size and leg strength. Nailed 13 or 15 kicks of 40-plus yards this season including seven of nine from 50-plus. Kicks have desired end over end rotation. Finished career as the 24th most accurate kicker in FBS history. Banged kickoffs into touchbacks at a rate of 75 percent over the last two seasons. Has good operation time with hasty approach to strike the ball. His obsessive-compulsive disorder helps to create an orderly approach that has in part led to his success.," Uses altered follow through for shorter kicks. Tends to short-leg shorter kicks, causing some inconsistencies with his accuracy. Takes questionable angles in his pursuit of kick returners. Has allowed three kick returns for touchdowns over last two seasons. Kickoff hang-time was slightly below average.", Round 3-4, Dustin Hopkins," Self-made, four-year starter who has steadily increased his kickoff distance and range as a field goal kicker. As the most prolific field goal kicker in FBS history, Gonzalez has a good chance of being drafted and becoming an instant starter."
Cole Hikutini,TE, Above average size for a move tight end. Moves well in space. Able to bend linebackers and safeties out of position with certain routes. Good acceleration out of his turns to separate and present quarterback with easier throws. Good in short zones. Seam-buster with speed to attack over the top of linebackers and run under the deep ball. Plus ball skills. Can track it and adjust in space. Natural hands pluck it away from his frame. Has speed and athleticism to extend plays after the catch. Dangerous mismatch option near goal line. Wins the 50/50 throws. Positional blocker who gives just enough effort to occupy defender in space., Needs to get tougher as a blocker. Not physical enough for that in-line life. Ducks head and grabs at the point of attack. Needs to be more aware of potential reroutes by linebackers and adjust his routes accordingly. Top of his routes lack sink and suddenness. Has to play strong after the catch to avoid being stripped on next level. Has just one year of production to his name., Round 6-7, Mychal Rivera, Athletic move tight end prospect with natural hands and the quickness to create separation along his routes. He has NFL ball skills to win in competitive catch situations and he will be a challenge for linebackers to cover in space. Hikutini lacks NFL toughness as a blocker which could put a ceiling on his draft value. He will have to prove he can play special teams as he waits for his turn as a pass-catching option.
Colin Holba,LS, Two-year long snapper. Has good velocity on both short and longer snaps. Field goal and extra point placement is very consistent. Snap-to-punt time is near NFL range. Has rangy frame with long arms and should be able to add more weight. Has snapped for both left and right-footed kickers., Could benefit from adding strength. Gives ground and allows push through his edges on field goals. Placement of punt snaps was a little low at times., PFA,, Has the placement and velocity necessary to be considered as a late-round pick in the draft.
Danny Isidora,G," Has size of an NFL guard with thick bubble and good arm length for interior. Big man with light feet and plus agility. Can lead the charge as pulling guard and has reactive quickness for sudden adjustments in space. Never loses sight of his second level target on work-up blocks. Strong hands can snatch and sustain his blocks. Won't linger on secure block long and climbs quickly up to linebackers. Instinctive. Recognizes when tackles are setting up twists and immediately searches for the second block. Will find additional work in pass protection. Patient and quiet with his hands and uses well-timed, stiff punch with inside hand. Feet can mirror throughout the rep.", Plays with an excessively wide base causing him to get jostled off-balance by power. Issues holding up to power showed up at the Senior Bowl practices. Had to fight overtime to maintain his positioning. More stalemater than block winner. Has some wasted motion in his movements in space. Needs to work feet into position for better block security. Can be frenetic up to second level. Allows momentum to carry him beyond his target at times., Round 5-6, Allen Barbre," Isidora is an athletic guard with good size and above-average hands who plays with a base that can get too wide. He has the lateral quickness to be a fit for teams looking to get their guards out in space, but his issues anchoring against bull-rushes at Senior Bowl were a concern. Isidora has enough talent to become a starter, but his issues holding up against power could derail those plans if he doesn't address them."
Rayshawn  Jenkins,S," Looks like a Miami safety with good size, long arms and an aggressive field demeanor. Looks to punish pass catchers over the middle and running backs looking to finish their runs against him. Has size and physicality to handle run support in the box. Gets wide as a tackler and fires from his hips. Does a nice job of reading keys when stepping downhill to fill his run fits. Might be able to handle coverage against matchup tight ends. Play speed is adequate for what he will be asked to do. Can chase and challenge the deep throws. Played some receiver in high school and shows that timing in his high-point challenges. Has soft hands to take it away when he's in position."," Doesn't make enough plays on the ball. Instincts are average and route anticipation needs work. Likes to see ball released before making commitment to close. Inefficient movement from high safety. Plays it too safe and needs to squeeze routes and take more chances. Average athlete. Opens hips from his backpedal before he needs to declare. NFL post routes could be a lot for him to handle. Can be sluggish in man coverage transitions, giving up too much separation. Comes downhill hot and will fly into tackle attempts at poor angles that result in misses. Needs to run into and through ball carrier rather than leaping from distance.", Round 3-4,," A commanding, aggressive presence on the back-end, Jenkins loves being part of ""The U"" and attempts to honor the history of the safety position at that school every time he steps on the field. His instincts and closing burst to the ball are just average and he will have to earn his way up the depth chart to get a shot as a two-deep safety with some box ability."
John Johnson,S," Has starting experience as cornerback and safety. Can play high safety or cover the slot. Plays with smooth hips and above average mirror and match footwork for the safety spot. At ease with directional changes in space. Adequate instincts in coverage. Will shade his coverage from high safety based on play development and quarterback's glances. Winning ball skills with very good ball tracking and soft hands. Interceptions don't just come his way, he goes and gets them. Has agility to take zig-zag downhill track to running backs. Bounces into run fits with lively feet and a tackle-ready base. Special teams monster with 30 tackles over the last three seasons on cover teams.", Tends to take passive routes to the ball when he's the last line of defense. Leverages to the sideline while drifting backwards rather than closing downhill. Features a small delay at top of his transition when triggering. Needs to improve physicality as a tackler. Feet deaden near point of impact. Needs to drive through his target and finish with his feet., Round 3-4, Aaron Williams," Ascending defender with the experience, athleticism and ball skills to play as a high safety or in man coverage. Johnson is well above average as a ball-tracker and has the soft hands to finish at the catch-point against receivers. He has decent size but won't be a banger as a tackler, however, his ability in coverage has NFL personnel men buzzing as a potential early starter in the league."
Damontae Kazee,CB, Good bounce in his feet for short area movement. Plays with a quick transition forward from his pedal when reacting to the route. Looks for most efficient route to the ball to disrupt the catch. Very good route awareness from zone. Can split the high-low combinations and anticipates the chosen route early. Highly instinctive with a taste for turnovers. Wants to make a play on every ball thrown his way. Posted 43 passes defensed over the last three years including 16 interceptions during that time. Active and downhill in his run support.," Tall and a little tight in his backpedal. Unable to carry deep speed down the field. Can be beaten over the top if he's not diligent with his positioning. Can be run out of position by play-action and jet sweeps that are directed his way. Has recovery quickness underneath, but is missing recovery speed. Takes unsound angles in run support and will lose contain. Lacks size for outside and could be mismatched against size.", Round 4,," Limited by his size and his long speed, Kazee has all the instincts and ball skills that a team could want. If he fails to run well, he could drop a round or even two, but he's a good fit for teams who run zone and off man. His willingness in run support and his penchant for taking the ball away should follow him into the pros and make for an early transition into a third or fourth cornerback role."
Tanoh Kpassagnon,DE," Big body and long frame. Should be able to continue packing pounds onto his frame. Flashes some upper body power with an ability to fight through move blocks. Has plus athleticism with explosive hip thrust that can jolt blockers at point of attack. Has lateral quickness to beat reach blocks and slice into the backfield. Has the tools to be a one- or two-gap player. Raw in his pass rush, but shows occasional glimpses into his potential. Athletic with range and above average tackle radius. Highly intelligent and very mature. History of blocking kicks will catch the eye of a special team's coach.", Average explosiveness up the field. Doesn't find ways to the edge as a pass rusher often enough. Too content to just ride on a stale bull rush. Plays with excessively narrow base and anchor. Functional contact balance seems to be a coin-flip from snap to snap. Legs don't always look steady under him. Tussles with blocker in front of him and loses track of the ball. Plays upright and gets pads turned too easily by blockers widening him out of the hole. Need to learn to use his length to punch and control at the point., Round 2-3, Margus Hunt," While he has the length, size and athleticism that is the foundation of what teams look for along their defensive front, his issues with contact balance and body control might not be easily remedied. Kpassagnon lacks natural pass rush talent and may need to strengthen his lower body so he can lock in as a two-gapping, edge-setting base end who can reduce inside on rush downs."
Brendan Langley,CB," Still raw, but very moldable for defensive backs coach who loves to teach. Has a stiff, disruptive punch from press coverage and can uncork it from his backpedal. Former wide receiver with excellent ball skills. Uses well-timed leaps to high-point the football like a basketball rebounder. Comfortable from bail coverage and shows the eye discipline to manage his man and the quarterback's eyes at the same time. Has desired length for the position with blazing speed to carry vertical routes down the field."," Technique from press coverage is all over the place. Narrow base causes poor balance in his transitions against an inside release. Ragged backpedal needs work. Doesn't have clean ""stick and drive"" footwork when triggering forward from his pedal. Struggles to stay in phase with receiver throughout the route. Had some really disappointing reps in one-on-one drills at the Senior Bowl allowing excessive route separation. Not an aggressive run supporter and will wait on running backs to take it to him.", Round 5-6, Anthony Brown," Langley is a ""size-speed"" prospect who could be taken much earlier than his Senior Bowl tape might dictate. Langley displays issues with his mirror and match footwork from press coverage and might be better suited in off-man or zone coverage where he can read quarterbacks and utilize his ball skills with the play in front of him. Langley has NFL backup potential."
Sefo Liufau,QB," Big, burly frame to handle physical demands of Colorado's offense. Four-year starter and three-year team captain who is beloved by his teammates and coaches for toughness and leadership qualities. Played through a bad ankle for much of the year to help lead Colorado out of the doldrums. Called ""tough, tough, tough competitor"" by Washington coaches. Run-pass quarterback who can bang out yardage on the ground when necessary. Throws deep ball with touch and is comfortable working outside the numbers on intermediate and deep throws. Good pocket mobility. Paces just ahead of league average for accuracy on all three levels of the field.", Mechanics are sloppy. Front side is wide open in many deliveries. Doesn't drive through the throw with his lower body and short arms his release. Delivery is stacked in two separate segments. Doesn't throw with enough anticipation. Will struggle to find work inside NFL passing windows. Had just 20 touchdown passes over final 663 pass attempts spanning two seasons. Ball should come out quicker on timing routes. A little delayed in working eyes from safety to first read., UDFA,," Liufau's toughness, leadership and competitive spirit is exactly what teams want and it happens to come in an NFL-ready frame. Unfortunately, his lack of timing and anticipation as a passer is one of the reasons his touchdown numbers are so low per attempt. While he showed an ability to run Colorado's offense with relative effectiveness, his game doesn't appear to translate to the NFL level."
Obi Melifonwu,S, Elite size with premium athletic traits that should show up at combine testing. Four-year starter. Sharp focus when ball is in the air. Takes path to the ball with undercut of the route at the last second. Plus hand-eye coordination to flip the field with interceptions. Former cornerback who has the athleticism to cover matchup tight ends and some big slots. Posted six interceptions over last two seasons. Uses big frame to body-up seam-runners and constrict their windows. Downhill tackling machine. Plus range with a wide net to bring runners down once he gets his arms into them. Body-up hitter. Drastically reduced penalties totals over junior and senior season., Leggy and gets feet bundled up when asked to turn and sprint. Lacks desired instincts and will play with slow eyes at times. Has to see ball in the air before charging over to help on deep throws. Inconsistent with coverage responsibilities from high safety. Takes time to diagnose play-action. Rub routes found him near goal line. Can take inefficient paths to the ball that get him there a step too late. Would benefit from high-pointing rather than waiting on throws., Round 2, George Iloka," Big and athletic, he may lack the coverage qualities and instincts needed to work as a ""last line of defense"" player in a pass-happy division. Melifonwu is an effective downhill tackler who has the ability to match up against tight ends and make a living near the line of scrimmage. His football instincts aren't up to par, but the size and traits will be extremely enticing for teams who covet traits first."
Jordan Morgan,G," Has desired NFL mass with adequate arm length and big hands. Plays with light feet when coming out of his stance and into his work. Always working feet into position to secure his block. Drive blocker who grinds from his in-steps. Composed in his movements in space. Operates with adequate bend in knees and ankles. Possesses aggressive field demeanor and is always looking to finish. Hand placement is generally inside the frame and offers up decent leverage points. Maxes out his arm length with stiff, potent punch that lands at full extension."," Ducks head as a run blocker at times. Needs to bring feet with him and up under his hips to increase potential to sustain blocks. Could struggle with balance early in his career. Needs to keep weight centered at his punch rather than lunging forward. May take time to get punch timed up with move from tackle to guard. Dominated smaller, less talented players across from him.", Round 4-5, Hugh Thornton," Four-year starter at left tackle who was able to physically overwhelm much smaller opponents across from him. Morgan is a good athlete with the nastiness as a run blocker that is necessary to transition inside to guard, but he could be headed for early struggles mirroring NFL rushers in pass protection. Morgan could become a solid NFL backup with eventual starter potential if he improves his balance and stops lunging."
Nathan Peterman,QB," Smooth, quick set-up in pocket. Grips the ball with big, 10-inch hands. Poised in pocket and takes the hit to deliver a completion. Will set-up, slide and then re-set before making his throw. Can cut it loose from off-balance angles from bootleg or play-action if he sees a winning option break open early. Full field reader. Works all the way through his progressions. Shoots glances at safeties to keep them in check. Strong natural accuracy. Able to throw receivers open and lead them away from danger. Can pinpoint passes to moving targets in his intermediate work. Has enough arm to work field side, intermediate throws. Great vision. Sees passing windows before they develop. Throws with outstanding timing and anticipation. Can put the ball on receivers' hands as soon as they come out of a break if coverage dictates it. Utilizes accuracy and anticipation to challenge windows on all three levels. Won at Clemson hanging five touchdown passes on their talented stop unit. Good escapability and can extend drives with his legs. Excellent deep ball accuracy completing 46.2 percent of his deep throws."," Inconsistent delivery base causes some throws to sail. Has instances where he short strides and is forced to muscle it to his target. Will float some throws on seams and dig routes. Will have to be mindful to drive the ball on pro level to avoid the ballhawks who are lurking at safety. Has to prove he has enough arm to challenge the same tight windows he did in college. Ball handling a little sluggish in wide receiver screens, hitches and most RPOs (run, pass option). Wants to play hero-ball at times. Needs to learn when to air-mail throw and move to next play rather than trying to get too cute with sideline throws. Can improve overall touch.", Round 3-4, Kirk Cousins," Peterman's experience in a pro-style passing attack gives him a head start headed into the league. His physical attributes are just average, but his accuracy, composure and anticipation are what sets him apart from some of the more physically gifted quarterbacks in this year's draft. Peterman's tape is sure to catch the eye of at least a few teams in need of a quarterback and he should come off the board by day two with a chance to become a solid starting quarterback in the future."
Carroll Phillips,OLB, Flashed disruptive quickness against the run this season. Effective in stunt game with sudden inside charge off snap. Pursuit motor and effort are above average. Chases beyond line of scrimmage for the stop. Rarely misses the mark as a tackler. Closes out the ball as much as possible before chesting up the tackle. Good agility and lateral slide quickness to track down ball carriers. Closing burst has necessary acceleration. Has balance and redirection to play in space. Adequate burst into his rush. Should benefit from wider rush angle as an outside linebacker in the pros. Consistent production posting a sack in eight of his 12 starts in 2016., Just one year as a full-time starter. Thin lower body possesses no emergency brake when blockers start driving him off the edge. Will need to add mass and muscle to handle run-stopping responsibilities and that may take time. Hand usage at point of attack is poor. Needs to keep punch inside the frame to maximize his length. Needs to learn hand skills to counter early punches and reset into an advantageous position. Surprising lack of edge-bending in his rush. Face-up rusher who is often punched with shoulders still parallel to line of scrimmage. Tracks to quarterback are too linear and lack improvisation., Round 4-5,," He's not very big, long or strong and his current pass rush approach won't cut it on the NFL level. However, his flexibility and agility could be viewed as moldable rush traits with the right position coach working the clay. Phillips will need to beef up some, but he didn't look out of place when asked to play in space at the Senior Bowl. Phillips has NFL backup talent but could work his way into playing time if he makes the necessary improvements as a rusher."
Antonio Pipkin,QB, Primary bread-winner for his offense over last two seasons. Has been able to produce with his arm and his legs. Quick ball-handler with an even quicker release on inside play-action from the gun. Can send the fades and seam throws on their way with a flick of the wrist when he's working quickly. Has legs to keep defenses honest on backside in zone-read. Has a great feel for exit routes from the pocket and can make defenses pay. Takes care of the ball. Unwilling to take unnecessary chances with the throws in traffic., Short for the position. Feet bouncy and become antsy once he's unable to deliver to his second read. Pocket poise needs work. Looks for a quick exit rather than continuing to scan the field and deliver to receivers coming open. Drops eyes when pocket gets a little noisy around him. Anticipation is below average. Will hesitate to cut it loose when he has a safety on the ropes. Field side accuracy and short throw touch need work. Will need to clean up a myriad of footwork issues., UDFA,," Pipkin's level of competition will clearly be a strike against him unless he steps up and has a big week at the Senior Bowl. He's undersized with an average arm and needs to improve his accuracy and pocket poise. While he has proven to be dangerous with the feet, he doesn't have the physical traits that teams are usually willing to take shots on late in the draft. He may find himself fighting to catch a team's eye from the undrafted free agent list."
Josh Reynolds,WR," Very long, angular frame. Outstanding high school triple jumper and high jumper will dominate combine explosion drills. Vertical threat who can open his hips and out-stride a cornerback down the field. As good as it gets as a ball tracker with a center fielder's ability to judge trajectory and distance. Stacks cornerbacks on his hip and keeps them there. Has access to a second gear when the ball is in the air. Routes feature little wasted motion. Possesses superior ball skills. Plus hand-eye coordination and holds his ground in contested catches. Can climbs way up the ladder and use his length to turn 50/50 balls into 80/20 his way. Consistent red-zone threat. Wins up-and-over, with back shoulder fades and with inside release to slant. Thin but ultra-competitive and extremely tough. Will work the middle and does not fear incoming traffic. Gets after his blocks on the perimeter and meets aggression with aggression as blocker.", Has a thin frame with skinny legs. Body is unlikely to carry much more weight. Can be temporarily grounded in press coverage. Lack of play strength makes fighting past disruptive jams a challenge. Needs to improve initial footwork and vary his releases. Just average underneath. Long-strider with limitations in short-area quickness. Nothing special in hitch-and-run or wide receiver screens. Has some trouble dropping down and digging out the low throw., Round 3-4, Marvin Jones," Long and tall, Reynolds is a dangerous vertical threat thanks to his ball tracking and ball skills over eye-popping deep speed. Reynolds is a menace in the red-zone and can mismatch smaller cornerbacks in the air. He lacks play strength which could cause problems for him early in his career against physical corners, but his toughness, work ethic and football intelligence should overcome those concerns and help him carve out a career as a second or third receiver in the league."
Ezra Robinson,CB, Opportunistic from zone coverage. Sifts through combination routes and comes out of the other side in position to crowd routes underneath. Will trigger into a passing lane when he senses quarterback is locking in. Looks to play through the catch point and has soft hands to pluck it and flip the field. Adequate foot quickness to match short and  intermediate routes. Has enough responsive athleticism when play is in front of him., Lacks functional strength. Physical receivers can jostle him around inside their routes and own him as run blockers. Backpedal needs to be ironed out. Shows lack of confidence in his recovery speed. Heavily penalized in coverage and is quick to grab and hold when he senses receiver is getting past him. Needs to open and sprint earlier to maintain his feel with deep routes and avoid the grabs. Passive and ineffective against the run. Will be heavily targeted in run support if he hits the field., UDFA,," Robinson has adequate height and length for the position and he's posted good ball production over the last couple of seasons. Robinson has enough athleticism to make even more plays on the ball, however, his lackadaisical field demeanor prevents it. Robinson's lack of competitiveness and toughness as a tackler will be an immediate turnoff for many teams."
Sam Rogers,FB," A little ball of aggression. Able to play on all three downs. Has experience as ball carrier, pass catcher, pass protector and lead blocker. Can block from multiple sets and formations. Consistently productive for three consecutive years. Low center of gravity provides additional power as a runner. Carries good acceleration and knee bend to his target. Viable play-action pass catching fullback. Gives good effort as a blocker. Able to stuff and seal on down blocks from wingback spot.", Gets over-amped in space as a blocker. Needs to play with less wasted motion and more body control. Second level blocking approach lacks patience at times. Squatty with short arms and struggles to sustain blocks against players with length., Round 7-PFA,," NFL size and length is absent from the package, but good luck finding teams who won't admire his versatility and competitiveness. Rogers is a move-blocking fullback with pass-catching ability who can also give you carries in a pinch. His roster flexibility greatly increases his opportunities to have a sustained career."
Fred Ross,WR, Handled a heavy target rate over last two seasons. Catches with strong hands and excellent arm extension. Capable hand fighter who is able to claw his way back inside against corners with leverage. Plays with good hand quickness to reach high and secure throws that are right on top of him. Does a good job of utilizing his body as a shield. Offers viable punt return option. Had 10 of his 37 punt returns go for 15 or more yards., Short-stepper with vertical limitations. Physical press corners can grind him up off the release. Lacks the long speed to back cornerbacks off of him. Had eight drops this season and 13 over last two years. Does not have the feet to shake a talented athlete across from him. Has tight hips and struggles mightily to make adjustments to poorly thrown balls. Lingers at top of his routes rather than firing out of his breaks. Can't create space through burst., Round 6-7,," Ross has adequate size and uses it effectively in space, but his hip tightness and lack of long speed are major concerns. Tight man coverage will be difficult for Ross to beat due to his lack of separation quickness. His route to the pros may be a zone-beater with punt return value."
Seth Russell,QB,,,,,
Tanzel Smart,DT, Excited to play football on every single rep. Times up snap and is quick into the neutral zone. Always searching for the ball. Uses hand quickness to disengage and tackle on time. Good football instincts and quick to recognize and react to screens. Plays with quick hands and quick feet that get him in position to make plays. Gets to blocker's edge with low center of gravity to drive up the field and disrupt. Able to fill a stat sheet up against both run and pass. Feet and hands are a whirlwind of action that never stop looking for improved positioning. Catches blockers under their pads and has the leg drive to bull them back into the pocket., Short and squatty frame. Matched up against below average competition on most weeks. Plays straight-legged which limits his change of direction. Lack of length causes him to swing and miss in tackle attempts against shifty runners. May not have enough raw power to make up for his lack of size. Long-armed guards can stab his chest and stick him in neutral., Rounds 5-6, Rakeem Nunez-Roches," He's a three-technique only who lacks desired size and length, but his quickness and disruptive nature lead to consistent production week in and week out. Smart needs to be in an upfield scheme that takes advantage of his ability to play in the gaps. His draft stock will take a hit due to his lack of measurables, but he has NFL backup potential thanks to his ability to rush the passer."
Jamari Staples,WR," Operates as the vertical threat in Louisville offense. Long strider with long speed. Had 80 percent of his catches go for first downs over last three years. Explosive leaper with springs in his hips. Can climb the ladder and win over the top. Plays with above average body control. Able to extend well beyond his frame to snare the throw. Scoops out low throws that seem impossible to save. Plays with good concentration when making combat catches. Stronger after the catch than he looks. Will shield, connect and sustain as a blocker. Praised by his coaches for work ethic and maturity."," Lanky target with a lack of strength. Has missed games in each of the last three seasons due to injury. Telegraphs his pattern. Changes stride length when nearing top of his route. Leans into slants prematurely allowing corners to get an early break. Cruises out of break points rather than explodes. Needs to work back to the ball more aggressively. Throws with pace can eat his hands up. Downfield contact throws off his play speed. On vertical routes, has a bad habit of gearing down when turning to look for the throw which allows balls to fall just out of his reach.", Rounds 6-7, Justin Hunter," Tall target with explosive speed and leaping ability. Staples' career numbers are unimpressive with his top touchdown production topping out at four his freshman season. His routes are sloppy and his inconsistencies as a vertical threat certainly don't help his cause. However, he should put together a big combine and will likely draw the attention of a team looking for a big-play lottery ticket they can try and develop as a third-day pick."
Freddie Stevenson,FB, Very fluid athlete in space. Has movement skill to make sudden changes to his blocking assignments when needed. Can keep a quick pace as lead blocker on wide flowing plays allowing the runner to play faster. Won't shy away from the aggressive iso-blocks. Drives feet through contact and can attack on angles for kick-out blocks. Has short yardage ability as ball carrier., Has limited reps in pass protection and very few catches. Can be a little late to find assignments at times. Can be stuffed to ground when launching into defender's legs too early in space., Round 7-PFA,," Athletic lead blocker who has an ability to lead the charge either downhill or on outside zone plays. Stevenson possesses an aggressive field demeanor and a good radar to land strikes in space. He lacks third down value, but can grind it out as a short yardage ball carrier. There will be a very limited amount of teams interested in a fullback this season, but Stevenson has enough ability to make a roster if he gets a shot."
Trent Taylor,WR, Above-average instincts in space. Will leak a slant up the seam if he sees safety has vacated. Makes slight alterations to routes in order to work through traffic and get to his break-point. Creates aggressive leverage points to push defender out of the pattern before stemming. Efficient in his movement. Natural ball catcher with extremely low drop rate. Throws seem to just sink into his frame. Has necessary toughness to work over the middle Explodes upfield after the catch and has enough wiggle to shake initial tackler. Willing to drop his shoulder and lay into cornerbacks who want to challenge him. Prolific pass catcher with an abundance of confidence.," Falls below desired size requirements for the position. Small, thin frame. Extremely short arms limit his catch radius. Has trouble plucking high throws and requires increased accuracy from his quarterback. Will need to pick up pace of his routes as a pro. Could struggle to uncover quickly against NFL-caliber athletes with length. Can do better job of finding softer spots in zone coverage. Caught just 21 touchdowns over his last 308 targets. Will put ball on the ground during run-after-catch. Has seven career fumbles.", PFA,," High-volume target with great hands and an ability to punch well above his weight class in the toughness department. Taylor's production is impressive, but his size and lack of explosive punt return talent could make his path to an NFL roster challenging."
Justin Vogel,P, Talented directional punter who is able to hang it near the numbers. Hang time is a plus. One of the best in the nation at forcing fair catches. Landed 40 percent of his kicks inside the 20-yard line. Career touchback rate is just 4.9 percent. Handled some kickoff duties as sophomore and junior and could get a team out of the game if needed due to injury., Net punting average is just okay. Needs to show a more consistently powerful leg from punt to punt. Will follow an open field punt of 56 yards with an open field punt of 38 yards., PFA,," Vogel doesn't have a booming leg, but he does have a shot at getting drafted and/or making a team thanks to his accuracy and consistency on placement punts."
Jamaal Williams,RB, Carries NFL size with a muscular build and good height. Able to bend at point of impact and attack with decent leverage. Uses his stiff arm as a weapon to escape tackles on an angle. Decisive runner. Sees it and goes. Not into dancing. Has a functional spin move he uses to spin out of tackles and grind out a few extra yards. Keeps his feet churning through contact. Above average ball security with a fumble rate of 140 (one fumble every 140 carries).," Bulls through running lanes crashing into blockers rather than shifting with the contours. Doesn't have athleticism to create early yardage for himself. Missing a functional jump cut for sudden shift from gap to gap once line of scrimmage muddies. Hit or miss with run lanes he chooses. Excessive forward lean creates issues with contact balance. Too easily felled by arm tackles. Banger, but not a tackle breaker. Doesn't have the speed to turn the corner when runs spill outside.", Rounds 4-5, Stepfan Taylor," His NFL size and physical nature give him a shot to make the back-end of the running back depth chart, but his inability to create for himself with broken tackles and elusiveness puts a ceiling on his draft value."
Jordan Herdman,LB, Plays with good power in his lower half. Able to brace up to redirects and then spin out of the block. Has some pop behind his lead shoulder that he throws into blockers. Instinctive and ready to trigger downhill after the ball. Effective reading keys. Has stop-start quickness with sudden change of direction. Good short-area quickness and reactive athleticism., Sawed off frame with short arms and small hands. Lack of length limits tackle radius and forces him to close out ball carrier before launching into tackle. Will have issues clearing the trees if he runs downhill too quickly. Will struggle to play the ball in pass coverage due to short arms., UDFA,, Packs some power in his compact frame and plays with good lateral quickness and quick feet. Herdman simply falls below the size and length requirements teams look for from the linebacker position. He will likely have to prove himself as an undrafted weakside linebacker prospect.
Lorenzo Jerome,S, Has outstanding instincts and ball skills. Has the strong hands and catch radius of a wide receiver. Takes direct paths to the ball and operates with optimal timing in attacks on the football. Ball production was through the roof during his entire career. Has experience playing over the slot and will overlap his coverage if he smells the football headed near him. Former high school quarterback with a good feel for the game. Rose to the occasion in a big way at both NFLPA game and Senior Bowl grabbing two interceptions in each of those games. Seems to find access to a second gear with the ball is in the air. Aggressive in run support. Races downhill and attacks the legs each and every time. Flashed dangerous potential as a kick and punt returner in all four years in college.," Lacks desired NFL size. Teams will want him to add weight to hold up to his physical style if his frame allows it. Scouts question his overall speed after a spring timing of 4.62 in the forty. Is a little bit tight hipped and he barely lifts his feet off of the ground when he runs. Benefitted from playing in slot, but may not be able to do that in NFL. Will grab receivers around the waist and hang on when beaten in a route. At times, gets so wrapped up in taking the ball away that he will get lax with his technique.", Round 4-5,," While he's not the biggest or fastest safety, he does not back down from the physicality of the position and he has a second gear when he's chasing after the ball. NFL teams love instinctive safeties who take the ball away and Jerome is working on a Master's Degree in both categories. Teams will have to decide how he best fits inside their defense, but Jerome's ability to return kicks and his ability to take the ball away should help him find the field fairly quickly."
Jonnu Smith,TE," Plays with urgency and looks to squeeze the most out of each play. Flashes an electric burst up the field and into his routes. Seam buster with ability to race over top of the linebacker and into a throwing window quickly. Plays fast. Talented, competitive runner after the catch. Mashes the gas and can run away from linebackers. Loose hips with slick lateral side step after the catch. Has ability to work on all three levels. Competitive high school weight lifter with good functional strength as a blocker. Shows willingness to handle the heavy lifting as zone scheme blocker. Uses good angles and timing in his combination blocks.", Body catcher who doesn't trust his own hands. Has dropped 10 passes over the last two seasons with too many double catches. Needs to do a better job of helping his QB by working to the ball and shielding. Gets grinded on by redirects out of his release into routes. Needs to learn how to adjust routes or disengage earlier. Not a convincing route runner and just kind of goes through the motion rather than selling fakes. Undersized for an in-line option. Frame may not be able to carry additional weight., Round 4, Delanie Walker," Athletic tight end with four years of pass-catching production and experience as an in-line blocker. Smith is electric after the catch and has the speed to attack all three levels of the field, but his inconsistent hands could hold him back. Smith's lack of size will likely push him into a ""move tight end"" role, but he's a more effective blocker in the zone game than many who have been asked to do it on the pro level."
Chad Williams,WR, Plays bigger than his size. Confident in his hands and snatches the ball way out in front of this frame. Shows some physicality after the catch and isn't easy to bring down. Hung 13 catches for 152 yards on Arizona early in the season. Uses body as a shield between the throw and the defender and can play as big as he needs to in space., Early route speed is below average. Takes too long to get to the top of his routes. Straight-liner. Heavy feet and stiff hips prevent shakes and jukes to allude early tacklers. Needs to run under the deep ball rather than gliding down the field. Can improve his adjustments on low throws. Character will need to be vetted thoroughly., Rounds 5-6,," Heavily targeted and highly productive against a lower level of competition. Williams has decent size and ball skills, but looks slow on tape with very disjointed route work. He needs to run well at his workout, but even if he does, he's a developmental prospect rather than an early helper."
Charmeachealle Moore,LB, Displays good aggression and will not flinch when taking on bigger men. Plays his role in run defense and will stick his nose inside to spill runs toward the sideline. Looks to body up as a tackler and will hit with all he has. Plays the game with intensity and passion. Was a quick study in the instincts department. Can drop quickly into space and has the hips and feet to flow with the quarterback's eyes in coverage. Aware of underneath routes and picks up crossing routes in space. Feet are lively and always moving., Just one season as a starter. Smallish linebacker who has difficulties unhinging when lineman get their hands on him. Gets overly aggressive in pursuit and will over-shoot his mark at times. Size limitations make angle tackles a chore. Falls off of too many tackles. Face-up blitzer who struggles to flip over the top of blockers and get to the quarterback., PFA,," Moore isn't the biggest linebacker out there but he plays with bright eyes and consistent intensity. Moore has experience playing inside and outside but may be best suited as a weakside linebacker in a 4-3. His draft stock could swing on his athletic testing, but his instincts and playing style should give him a head-start with a position coach who appreciates his approach. Moore could be an early practice squad candidate."
Darreus Rogers,WR," Has some early quickness in his release up the field against press coverage. Keeps cornerbacks at bay with sly hand usage and doesn't allow cornerbacks to crowd his frame. Puts smaller defenders in his hip pocket once he gets over the top of them. Ball skills are his biggest weapon. Uses well-timed leaps, and strong hands to climb over defenders and win the high-point throws. Plays with excellent body control and balance in mid-air. Snatches passes with good arm extension with soft, reliable hands. Excels with contested catches. Competitive runner after the catch with shake to elude first tacklers and a stiff-arm at his disposal."," Looks slow on tape. Timed speed at his pro day was even more abysmal than the tape. Had very limited number of explosive catches. Doesn't have much experience with the complete route tree. His sell jobs on route fakes is unconvincing. Routes lack leverage and the illusion of intent. Too eager to default to contested catches rather than work to create separation. Can improve route adjustments against zone including finding safer areas to sink into for his quarterback. Will drop would-be catches downfield once he hits the ground. Has size to lock in as a blocker, but doesn't maintain positioning.", PFA,, Rogers is one part vertical receiver with great ball skills and no deep speed and one part possession receiver with below average route-running but very good hand-eye coordination. His size will work in his favor but his ridiculously slow 40 time will make it hard for him to get a legitimate shot unless he bulks up and tries to repurpose himself as a matchup tight end.
"Greg Ward, Jr.",WR,,,,,
Robert Leff,OT, Flat-backed pass sets. Smooth in his slides out to pass rusher. Gains adequate ground to challenge edge rushers up the arc. Keeps his chin tucked and out of his punch. Has enough smoothness in his redirect to slide back inside and catch stunting defensive ends. Plays with good body control on the move. Efficient double team blocker and is rhythmic in his work-up blocks to second level. Able to frame his blocks in space and has reactive athleticism for last second adjustments., Length is lacking. Gets controlled at the point of attack and easily discarded by power and length. Appears to lack the necessary functional strength to handle NFL power. Unable to sustain blocks for long due to his physical deficiencies. Slow to throw his hands and is frequently beaten to first contact by defenders. Early mirror gives way to late balance issues when trying to run rushers beyond the pocket. Offers no drive as a base blocker and struggles to get any shoulder turn at point of attack., PFA,," Leff's lack of length and ability to handle power on the edge makes a career as a tackle unlikely. He lacks the the desired power and hand quickness for the guard spot, but could probably get by in a zone scheme. He is fluid on the second level so it wouldn't surprise to see a team try him as a center with potential guard roster flexibility. If he doesn't have enough core strength, it won't matter."
Levon Myers,OT," Light on his feet. Has movement skills and foot quickness that translate to the tackle position if a team desires to keep him there. Arm length above average. Keeps feet driving after contact and runs them under his hips to improve contact balance. Has agility to make blocks in space when asked to pull or to work up to linebackers. Uses feet to slide over and catch inside moves rather than relying on bending and lunging. Adequate pass pro posture and could have swing tackle value. Looks to finish his blocks. This season, tape showed a particular disdain for everyone on the San Diego State defense as he challenged them with chippy, aggressive play at every turn."," Plays too tall in general. Has some natural flexibility, but doesn't always play with bend. Down blocks tend to come from his upper body over leg drive. Will slide up and off of power blocks at times. Catches rather than punches which limits effectiveness of his reach. Shoots his hands from balls of his feet rather than flat-footed opening himself to bull-rush attempts. Loses his cool and has a hard time settling back in. Inconsistent footwork in redirects inside. Plays with a narrow base as drive blocker. Needs to open it up a bit.", PFA, Vaitai Halapoulivaati," Athletic prospect with potential roster flexibility that could push him up some draft boards. While Myers has the movement ability to play guard in a zone scheme, some teams may also view him as a legitimate swing tackle with the athleticism and length to play either tackle spot. Myers moves well, but he's not a finesse player. In the right fit, he could be an eventual starter and is no worse that a scheme-flexible backup."
Brian Allen,DB, Tremendously long. Will stick his jabs into receiver's chest from press coverage and disrupt the release. Looks comfortable in bump-and-run coverage. Has ability to use length as a recovery tool. Limited just 42.5 percent of targets his way to be completed over the last two seasons. Size casts a tall shadow from trail coverage that makes it challenging to complete the deep touch throw over him. Still very raw and inexperienced and should continue to improve with coaching. Showed off impressive long speed at the combine.," Former wide receiver who said he ""didn't know how to tackle"" when he made the switch and still has issues with it. Ducks head into contact and rarely squares up his target. Finishing rate as a tackler was way below desired rate. Ball skills aren't where they need to be. Slow to find the deep throw and make adjustments to the ball path. Allowed 21.7 yards per completion in 2016. Could struggle badly against a bombs-away offensive approach. Hips and feet are clunky when forced to open suddenly in off-coverage and he loses balance too often in transitions forward.", Rounds 5-6,," On the surface, Allen is nowhere near ready to play NFL football. He lacks smooth feet and hips in coverage, a feel for routes and is below average playing the deep ball. His issues as a tackler make it unlikely a team would trust him to move to safety. However, his elite size, speed and length are sure to garner attention and he does flash some potential as a bump-and-run corner. Allen could be a late-round pick who is stashed on a practice squad while a team tries to improve his technique."
"Victor Bolden, Jr.",WR,,,,,
Kendrick Bourne,WR," Tall with good arm length and plays the game as a physical receiver. Decent initial burst up the field to take an early lead against press-and-miss corners. Has above average sharpness to his routes underneath. Has very quick, natural hands as a pass catcher. Can react suddenly to pluck throws that are right on top of him. Very good hand fighter down the field to keep himself clean and maintain leveraged position for a viable throwing window near boundary. Excellent ball tracking and route adjustment skills. Has an alpha demeanor when it's time to go win the ball. Competitive, tough runner after the catch with a nifty open-field spin move.", Didn't face anywhere near the competition level across from him that he will face in the pros. Easy wins against press coverage that turned into long vertical catches will be much more challenging. Rarely saw safety help shaded his way. Lacks acceleration coming out of his route stem. Does not have access to a second gear that can run under the ball and scouts question his long speed., PFA, Rashard Higgins," Scouts expect Bourne to run on the wrong side of a 4.60 40, and if that is the case, it will certainly hurt his draft cause. With that said, he's tall with strong, natural hands and has the good ball skills teams want down the field. He will have to prove that he has the speed and athleticism to uncover against NFL cornerbacks, but he has enough talent and toughness to compete for a roster spot as a possession receiver."
Tashawn Bower,DE, Long-levered edge man with good muscular development. Has frame for additional weight if needed. Transition from 4-3 to 3-4 defense this season seemed to suit him. Light appears to be coming on for him. Uses length to stab tight ends and take control of the edge. Adequate lower body power to battle against tackles. Flashes a serviceable burst out of his stance and into his rush. Has a rarely used inside spin counter that has some potential if developed. Foot quickness gives him a shot as interior rusher in sub packages. Fluid and athletic in space. Showed ability to match up in space against Wisconsin to start the season., Made just seven starts over his four seasons. Saw limited reps as a pass rusher resulting in limited rush production. Three of his 5.5 sacks came in his final game in the Citrus Bowl against Louisville. Raw as a pass rusher. Needs to learn how to use hands and length to pry open the edge. Will gear down rather than explode around the edge when being redirected. Would benefit from playing faster more consistently. Scouts concerned about strength to leverage his gap. Focuses on being physical over being explosive.,,," Developmental prospect with intriguing size and length. Bower's physical and athletic traits could make him a target for both 4-3 and 3-4 defenses, but he will need to prove he can find the quarterback more consistently if he wants to earn reps in the league. Bower was stuck behind a talented defensive front, but he flashes often enough to believe that he could develop into a better pro than college player."
Blair Brown,LB," Downhill linebacker always looking to make plays in the opponent's living room. Very instinctive. Key reader who trusts his eyes and is quick to pull the trigger and rocket into gaps if he sees an opening. Generally plays ahead of blocks. Possesses an urgent, physical mindset. Extremely efficient tackle finisher who very rarely lets one get away. Quick to find football on play action and at the mesh point of zone reads. Plays with little hesitation. Sniffs out screens almost immediately. Scrapes with square pads and a controlled, balanced slide. Has good play strength and attacks iso-blocks with leverage. Good short-area burst to close out running backs. Can drop into space and shows the ability to drag running backs on swing routes.", Has short arms and lacks desired length at the position. Needs to improve his hand usage rather than always taking on blocks with his shoulder. Can get stuck to blocks once a long-armed tackle gets into him. May not have the pure speed to recover to the perimeter if he takes a bad angle against the run. Lacks slightly in change of direction fluidity. May have issues handling man coverage on the next level. Can be too relaxed when dropping into space. Has had no passes defensed over the last two seasons., Round 4-5, Gary Brackett," Brown isn't going to check off the ""physical traits"" boxes for teams who always prioritize height-length-speed at linebacker, but he gets a big check mark in the ""find ball, get ball"" box. He's instinctive and has the play strength and leverage to fight through blocks and make his way into tackling position. Despite just one season of high-end tackle production, he has the anticipation, athleticism and toughness to make a roster and eventually challenge for playing time."
Fadol Brown,DE," Has the desired size and length. With a little more weight, could get consideration as a defensive end by both 4-3 and 3-4 teams. Uses his long arms and upper body power to set a strong edge. Gets good arm extension post-punch and is able to control and shed his blocker early in order to launch himself into a tackle attempt. Saw 40 percent of his tackles over last two years come on gains of two yards or less. Uses an arm over inside pass rush as his pet move. Throws combinations with his hands to keep offensive tackles on the ropes. Plays with adequate lateral quickness and closing burst.", Was an ineffective pass rusher at Ole Miss. Hands can be a little lazy into his first strike causing him to lose the battle for the frame. Plays way too straight-legged at the point of attack. Can be knocked out of his gap by angle blocks. Pass rush needs much more knee bend in order to improve his contact balance. Inside charges become easy re-direct blocks for tackles taking advantage of his high center of gravity. Lacks a rush plan or an ability to challenge the edge. Lingering issues with a stress fracture in his foot could be cause for concern as combine medicals roll around., Round 5-6, Martin Ifedi," While his size and length will immediately appeal to some defenses, his inability to generate a consistent pass rush will turn others off. Provided his medicals check out, Brown's physical traits could get him a late look on Day 3, but his ceiling may be as a backup defensive end for either a 4-3 or 3-4 front."
Pharaoh Brown,TE," Big available target with good mass in both his upper and lower body. Has played in-line, as an H-back and from the slot. Will occasionally flash some potential as a blocker. Has enough foot quickness to get to reach blocks. Long strider with some build-up speed still left in the tank. Searches and sinks into space against zone. Tough and resilient. Uses his frame to post-up and stack defenders on goal line routes.", Not instinctive as run blocker and takes some questionable angles in space. Looked less athletic and seemed to slow down as the season progressed. Unable to uncover at the top of his routes. Not a natural hands catcher to put it mildly. Tape is filled with drops and double-catches. Posted a double-digit drop rate in every season at Oregon. Often looked hesitant after the catch. Scouts concerned about his character. Gruesome leg injury from 2014 will get substantial vetting by medical staffs at combine., PFA,," Brown's 2014 leg injury appears to have taken away some of his functional athleticism and separation quickness. Brown has good size, but his poor hands and inconsistencies as a blocker will make it tough for him to stick on a roster unless he gets back to where he was pre-injury."
Collin Buchanan,OL," Wide body who carries his weight well. Sturdy build in his lower half. Can unlock his hips to sink and sit when dropping his anchor against bull rusher. Plays with a nice, wide base in both his pass sets and run blocking. Pass sets feature good balance and posture. Light enough on feet to handle twists and stunts inside. Throws his hands in a direct line and with consistent timing while keeping his head back in pass sets. Uses choppy power steps in his approach into contact. Sufficient work bringing hips under hands after contact. Patient climbs to second level."," He is able to bend, but has to work on maintaining a consistent pad level to stabilize his core. Has issues with aim when he throws his hands. Has too many reps where his punch will land near top of the pads or even bottom of face mask. Lack of placement allows defenders to clear his hands from their frame too easily. Will likely bump inside and will have to prove he can handle the pace and strength of interior work. Can get too grabby with second level blocks.", Round 3-4, Quinton Spain," Thickly built offensive linemen who is likely to move inside due to a lack of length. Buchanan has decent hand quickness and good feet for the interior and he shows the necessary anchor to battle back against bull-rushers. He doesn't appear to have scheme limitations, but he is better suited for a gap scheme. Buchanan's balance and athleticism are good enough to offer value as a backup right tackle which should add to his value on the third day. He could challenge for a starting position within the first couple of years."
Harrison Butker,K,,,,,
Christopher Carson,RB, Built like an NFL running back. Chiseled from granite with a broad chest and thickly muscled shoulders. Reinvented himself from finesse to power after ribbing in the running backs meeting room. Lead shoulder carries pop in it. Drops pads at impact and is able to drive through initial contact. Bow-legged gait produces wider frame with better balance. Leg tackles often slide off and are left with nothing. Will press line of scrimmage to set up subtle cutback opportunity. Able to create separation out of backfield on crossing routes. Has adequate wiggle in open field after the catch. Never fumbled in 212 carries at Oklahoma State.," Runs with tight hips and low-knee action. Runs too upright. Missing the flexibility to sink and cut sharply. Long strider who will struggle to gather his feet quickly enough for sudden change of direction against early penetration. Burst through line of of scrimmage is average. Lacks explosive, playmaking potential. Never notched a rush of over 26 yards during his 212 carries at Oklahoma State. Missed time this season and last with injuries.", Round 7-PFA,," Carson is an immediate winner of the eyeball test, but that hasn't always been true of his running style. His shift from finesse to a more power-based running style fits his size and physical attributes and gives him a better shot of playing on Sundays. Carson is suited to a downhill attack that allows him to be the hammer rather than the nail, but he's unlikely to create for himself with elusiveness or speed. If Carson works out well, he could hear his name called on Day 3."
Cethan Carter,TE, Able to sustain move blocks in space against safeties and cornerbacks. Has the athleticism to get to his play-side angles as a zone blocker. Operates with good hand placement as a blocker most of the time. Gives adequate effort in running game. Gets off the line and into his route with adequate speed. Opens quickly out of the top of his route and makes himself a wide target for the quarterback. His 2015 tape shows the speed and athleticism to work the deep middle and intermediate routes., Hands were bad over the last two years with 10 drops against 43 catches. Struggles with hands when ball gets above the waist and with most quick-reaction catches. Limited catch radius with short arms and small hands. Offered little run-after-catch potential at Nebraska. Routes are raw and lack quality. Features too much forward lean as both a pass and run blocker causing him to tumble forward off of blocks. Needs to learn to run his feet under his hands for better block security. May be too small to handle in-line duties as a blocker., PFA,," Carter is a block-first, move tight end in the Nebraska offense but he lacks the size and ability to sustain at the point of attack to handle in-line blocking duties on the next level. He may not have the hands or route separation to handle pass-catching duties on the next level and he has played sparingly on special teams. To carve out a spot on a roster, Carter will have to prove that he can do one of those things well."
Chuck Clark,DB," Durable three-year starter. Productive tackler who shows no hesitation to step downhill. Tracks ball carriers with balanced, leveraged approach. Under control as a tackler. Efficient and diligent in his mirror of the quarterback. Head stays on a swivel from receiver back to quarterback. Plays with elevated instincts. He will start breaking on throws at the beginning of quarterback's windup. Has enough range to play over the top and will plant his flag in the ribs of pass catcher to dislodge the throw. Plays with good route anticipation in man coverage. Not easily duped by bunch formations or misdirection. Maintains leverage against slot receivers and crowds in-breaking routes while looking to disrupt at the catch point.", A shade smaller than teams will like from a combination safety. Can be manipulated by quarterbacks who push safeties around with their eyes. Shows a little stickiness in his hips when faced with coverage transitions. Aggressive nature gets him tangled in the sticky web of play-action fakes. Occasionally voids coverage responsibility to chase running plays that aren't there., Rounds 6-7,, Clark is a little smaller than the NFL norm and that will likely hurt him some on draft day since the safety position is often drafted based heavily on physical traits. Clark is a willing tackler who can play a combo safety role thanks to his instincts and ball skills. Position coaches may end up liking him much more than the evaluators who are tasked with finding traits-based talent. Clark could become a third safety who works his way into playing time.
Jeremy Clark,CB, Exciting size and length outside. Is an imposing figure in press coverage. Maximizes arm length when attacking passing lanes. Ball skills are solid. Athletic enough to play in multiple coverages. Displays necessary timing for high-point disruption even in a retreat. Able to maintain his feel for route down the field. Has a make-up gear when beaten and can close out separation distance. Looks to run through the receiver and deliver some thump after the catch. Heads up tackler looks to attack the legs and wrap-up. Has potential to challenge for a role as gunner or jammer on special teams., Leggy transitions can put him behind when forced to open and run. Tends to bend at the waist and lean into receivers when matching their release. Lacks fluidity to recover quickly when beaten by route fakes. Will struggle to stick with complex routes. Doesn't always play to his size. Slow to disengage from perimeter blocks. Too passive on the perimeter and needs an angrier heart against the run. Needs to improve his lower body strength. Season-ending ACL tear will likely prevent him from running and proving his speed pre-draft., Round 7-PFA,," Because Clark's recovery from an ACL tear makes it unlikely he'll be able to run pre-draft, teams may be hesitant to consider him as anything other than an undrafted free agent. However, the tape shows decent makeup speed to go along with his extreme length. Clark could challenge for a roster spot with teams looking for bump-and-run corners with an ability to operate on special teams."
Tarik Cohen,RB," Nicknamed ""The Human Joystick"" for his ability to make seemingly impossible cuts. Plays with unpredictable movements. Can turn any play into a random game of ""connect the dots."" Rare ability to stop and start. Cuts are just as seamless and sharp from any direction. Field vision is excellent. Has lateral escapability to put would-be tacklers on his highlight tapes. Gifted with unusually large hands and a powerful lower body that enhances his contact balance and ability to drive for extra yardage. Very good acceleration pulls him away from tacklers and into the clear. Relentless competitor. Had four touchdown runs of 83-plus yards this season. A true weapon out of the backfield that will be tough to matchup with. Has good hands and is very slippery in space."," Falls below the size standards expected from the position. Overwhelmed slower and less talented competition. Benefitted from heinous angles to the ball from tacklers he faced. Way too eager to take plays off script. Wants to swing for the fences on every snap and will have to learn when to hit singles. Too eager to bounce everything. Takes his share of negative yardage carries. Feet are electric, but footwork and run track on zone plays needs work. Takes big hits from big men when trying to fight out of tackles and squeeze out extra yards. Stature and short arms make him a tougher target for quarterbacks. Has almost no experience as a punt or kick returner on special teams.", Rounds 5-6, Darren Sproles," Cohen uses a bounding, bouncing approach to the line of scrimmage reminiscent of Le'Veon Bell, but he's far less likely to finish downhill and instead looks to break it wide and out-race defenders. He's an electric playmaker who needs touches, but he's too small and unpredictable to handle much of an NFL carry count. Cohen gets easy separation as a receiver out of the backfield or from the slot and he will likely be used as an updated version of Darren Sproles 2.0."
Aviante Collins,OT, Comes from athletic bloodlines so his quickness and ease of movement should come as no surprise. Height and arm length are below average for tackle position. Has lateral quickness for reach blocks and has the feet to keep his block tied to inside shoulder on play-side blocks. Is diligent with his feet looking to work them into optimal position after initial contact as run blocker. Overcomes some of his power deficiency with footwork and body control. Has an accurate radar to strike a blow on open field targets when asked to pull. Able to mirror in pass sets and stay connected to defender. Plays with some edge in his game. Finishes his blocks and not afraid to get a little chippy with opponents.," Frame could use more mass and definition. Somewhat narrow through shoulders and hips and may not have the frame to carry desired weight. Pad level coming off the ball is a little too high. Needs to do a better job of bending his knees and looking to strike from a leveraged position on second level. Is a little light in the power department. Below average as base blocker. Fear of being overwhelmed by power leads to wide, bear-hugging hands. Lacks discipline in his pass sets and will cross feet over to chase edge rushers. May be zone-only fit.", Rounds 5-6,," The more you watch of Collins, the more you like. His athleticism is the first thing you will notice, but his toughness and determination to stay tied to his blocks are what will start to win you over. Finding the right fit will be the problem. He lacks size and length as a tackle and his below average hand usage will get him in trouble against bull rushers if he moves to guard. Collins is a talented move blocker, but he may need a year or two to get stronger and to tighten up some technique issues."
Ethan Cooper,OL, Big NFL-caliber frame. Thick from his calves to his shoulders. Has experience at both tackle and guard. Possesses good upper body power. Lateral quickness is adequate. Runs his feet through contact looking to turn opponent out of the hole. Plays with decent feet in space. Shows ability to adjust to moving targets on second level. Has desired body control and balance for his size. Scouts say he has good football intelligence with an understanding of defensive concepts., Needs to work to keep pad level lower. Lack of bend and a little bit of a narrow base prevent him from getting as much drive at the point of attack as he should. Down blocks and work-up blocks tend to be more segmented and less rhythmic. Punch is a little wide and will need a more direct route to the frame. Has a tendency to let his weight get out in front of him in pass protection. Will take time to adjust to NFL level of competition for him., Rounds 6-7,," Cooper is tough to get a read on due to the level of competition he plays. He is good but not dominant as a run blocker, which is a little surprising based on his girthy frame. He doesn't play with as much hip torque as you want so he will probably always have some limitations as a drive blocker. He's a decent athlete with an NFL frame and that should help him go as a developmental Day 3 draft prospect."
Darrell Daniels,TE," Has absolutely freakish physical attributes. Arm length and hand size would be considered outstanding for an offensive tackle. Stretches high and outside his frame to make the catch. Hands are supple and strong and the ball tends to stick to them at impact. Plucks it away from his body and can secure through contact. Carded a verified sub 4.50 40-yard dash during spring. Short strider, but feet turn over rapidly to propel him down the field. Can work the third level. Adjusts his path to off-target deep throws. Team-first player and vocal leader. Has successful stint as a cover man on special teams in his background."," Doesn't always play to his timed speed. Production is below expected level for his physical attributes. Had just 47 touches and five touchdowns over three years. Got open with speed alone and benefited from misdirection, play-action and borderline pick plays. Doesnt use quality fakes and speed variances to create movement from safeties. Blocks with locked-out knees and little hip bend. Lacks physicality and aggressiveness be counted on as a blocker.", Round 7-PFA,," Converted wide receiver who is definitely a pass catcher rather than a combination tight-end who can handle blocking assignments as well. Daniels' combination of athletic ability and physical traits figures to land him as a third-day draft pick, but he will have to learn to run routes more effectively as a matchup tight end in the NFL or he will find himself stuck on the practice squad for a couple of seasons."
Robert Davis,WR," Big body with an NFL frame to bang. Bodies through his routes and uses size to push back against force. Former high school basketball player with high-point timing and above average ball skills in a crowd. Long arms and big hands give him extended catch radius. Has decent foot quickness for his size and should be able to see results from more route work on the next level. Able to go up and make athletic, twisting adjustments in mid-air to pull in errant passes. Can secure the catch through punishing hits."," Plays with tight hips and little sink into routes causing prolonged braking before opening. Route running is extremely raw. Routes are very rounded, lacking definition and effectiveness. Needs to leverage defenders back inside on his deep work to create more catch space to the boundary. Will sit and wait on throws rather than working back aggressively. Lacking in long speed. Will glide on some deep routes rather than continuing to crank it full speed throughout the route. Won't get away from tackler very often after the catch.", Rounds 5-6, Aaron Dobson," On the surface, Davis is a big receiver who lacks deep speed and has a hard time creating clean passing windows for quarterbacks. However, he's a decent athlete who could benefit greatly from extended route work and learning the nuances of the position. Davis is a project with some moldable traits who may have enough talent to find his way into the league once his skills and fundamentals are honed. Davis could be a practice squad stash with the ability to grow into an NFL backup."
Dylan Donahue,DL, His footwork and lateral quickness puts him in position to go make a play. Uses slaps and chops to batter a tackle's punch and gain advantage on the edge. Comes off snap low and with good burst. Has flexible hips and good overall bend in lower half to unleash a more dynamic pass rush attack. Relentless forward charge that leads to second effort sacks and tackles. Pursuit continues down the field. Finds ball quickly and works to shed and tackle on time. Has range and athletic traits to transition to outside linebacker spot quickly. Posted monster production at West Georgia against run and pass. Comes from NFL bloodlines., Undersized and lacks NFL length. Short arms will always be a concern against tackles and tight ends with quick hands who can get into his frame first. Will struggle to take a stand and set a strong edge against NFL power. Hand usage is somewhat basic. Needs to work towards a Masters degree in hand fighting to counter his poor arm length. Has to rely on motor over power and skill to win second half of the rep. Face-up rusher who lacks desired speed-to-power element. Needs to add competent counter rush move., Rounds 5-6, Nick Vigil, Donahue is a productive but undersized outside linebacker who lacks the desired length and strength at the point of attack that teams typically look for on the edge. Donahue has some explosive movement and lateral agility that could help him translate into a 4-3 defense with rush potential in sub-packages. His athleticism should serve him well on special teams and his ability to make impactful plays could land him on a roster.
Ken Ekanem,DL," Possesses power in his hands. Subtle but sharp with his two-hand swipe designed to brush a tackle's punch aside. Able to generate moderate pocket push with his bull-rush. Uses effective left hand stab, right hand chop rush move to soften the edge and turn the corner. Has lower center of gravity and leg strength push through the blocker's shoulder once he gets to an edge. Doesn't stay engaged with blocks for very long. Bodies up with a thud as a tackler. Has some experience standing and dropping into space. Productive sack man with a key-in motor over the last three seasons for the Hokies."," Lacks height and length of a defensive end and may have to transition to 3-4 outside backer. Face-up, tight-hipped player. Long-armed tackles can stick him to the end of their jab and ride him out of the gap on run plays and up around the arc as a pass rusher. Doesn't get optimal explosion up the field out of his stance. Missing the flexibility and upper body turn to flip over the top as a rusher. Predictable rush track lacks an effective, inside counter. Below-average reactive quickness. Shifty runners leave him grasping and chasing. Closing burst is below average.", PFA,," On paper, Ekanem will be lacking in both the physical and athletic traits that teams will want out of either a defensive end or outside linebacker. However, he has functional power, above average hands and a toughness to his game that could translate in the right scheme and for the right coach."
Jermaine Eluemunor,OG," Girthy, wide body with big bubble and exceptional weight room strength. Functional lateral quickness makes him scheme diverse. Has feet to mirror in pass pro. Has the active feet and movement ability in space to handle combo blocks. Well conditioned. Able to withstand Texas heat and Texas A&M;'s offensive pace. Has limited football experience and should continue to grow in knowledge and technique. Shows potential to improve with unlocking hips. Hand strength allows him to punch and snatch inside the frame and lock into opponents. Powerful upper body and good core strength provide ammo for sustaining blocks. Experience at right tackle creates roster flexibility."," Came from overseas and still inexperienced relative to most at his position. Football instincts and intelligence are a work in progress. Has relatively short arms and small hands. Too much wasted motion with feet. Hops and bounces as drive blocker rather than sitting down and driving with powerful, choppy steps. Darting three techniques could be an early issue. Has some forward lean into pass sets. Carries hands very low before punching. Will need to play with compact, quick punch as a guard. Inside hand flies too far outside the frame. Lack of experience creates confusion against twists.", Rounds 3-4, Alvin Bailey," Got a late start in the sport and his football intelligence can suffer at times because of it. Eluemunor's girthy frame and core strength are two big check marks for his move inside to guard. Despite his weight, he is light on his feet and can handle zone blocking responsibilities or can pull for teams looking to utilize him in power. Eluemunor is still considered a developmental prospect, but his size and strength could make him an eventual starter in time."
Shelton Gibson,WR," Flat. Out. Fast. Has run-by speed on the go routes and can create immediate separation over the top against cornerbacks who overestimate their acceleration. Saw 36 percent of his catches go for 25-plus yards over last two seasons. Ball skills and hand-eye coordination are substantially better down the field than on the short routes. Finds the deep throw quickly and makes necessary adjustments to ball flight to put himself in the best position to make the catch. Fear of his speed creates open, unchallenged throws underneath against spacious cushions. Athletic and not just a tight-hipped, straight line runner. Explosive leaper who can climb the ladder and extend way up over his head to snare the errant passes and bring them home. Has immediate gunner potential and can return kickoffs."," Displays focus issues with his hands when working underneath. Had a case of alligator arms over the middle against Texas after taking a punishing hit a quarter earlier. Will need to learn to run more of the route tree and sharpen his skills as a route runner in general. Made a living on nine routes, posts, slants and curls. Gets to top gear quickly creating issues with excessive steps in his gear down into his breaks. Needs to do a better job of aggressively working back to the ball and scrambling with his quarterback into a catch-friendly area of the field.", Round 4-5, Corey Coleman," Gibson has good size and is an all-day field stretcher with blazing speed to climb over the top of cornerbacks quickly and the ball skills to finish the catch. While his hands can be a little inconsistent underneath and his routes are underdeveloped, his size-speed combination will offer a team a homerun hitter who forces defenses to keep a safety shaded his way. Gibson could be a low-volume, high-impact starter fairly early in his career."
Shaquill Griffin,DB," Has good size and strength. Has a disruptive punch and feet to impede in press coverage. Loose and athletic in his movement. Able to flip hips and match receivers without giving up much early separation in his transition. Allowed just 32.9 percent of throws his way to be completed. Possesses plus ball skills. Uses well-timed leaps and strong hands to challenge at the catch point. Is a rake it or take it cornerback with 34 passes defensed over the last two seasons, including six interceptions. Runs through targets looking to jar the catch loose. Aggressive in run support. Looks to play through receivers on the way to the ball. Can wrap up or chop down running backs.", Long speed is very average and will allow some vertical separation against speedsters. Had difficulties staying with Michigan wide receiver Amara Darboh in Week 3 of this season. His instincts and anticipation are just average. Can be slow with pattern recognition on combo routes. Has issues maintaining his coverage distance from man-off. Plays tall in space limiting his transition quickness when attempting to mirror receivers out of their route breaks. Has to be careful not to lunge when trying to reroute receivers after their release., Round 3, Ladarius Gunter," Griffin plays the game with an aggressive tilt both in coverage and in his run support. Griffin has good ball skills with a closing burst to challenge throws, but his anticipation is just average and he may not be able to play off of receivers and still be as effective with his ball production. Because he lacks long speed but is an effective tackler, he could be targeted by a defense favoring Cover-2 coverage."
Keon Hatcher,WR," Stout build with plenty of muscle packed on his frame. Tough player who doesn't back down from physical corners. Plus foot quickness off the line of scrimmage. Swipes and slaps away jams and redirect attempts throughout his route. Natural, fluid athlete in space. Hands were reliable this season. Can make quick, stabbing grab of the football when he finds it late. Showed great concentration to finish catches in traffic against aggressive Alabama secondary. Effective working down the field with 80 percent of his catches going for first downs. Has field awareness to gear down route and wait for the throw when working near boundary. Has history of fighting through adversity."," Needs to show better improvisation in adjusting routes. Goes where route takes him and will just bang into defenders. Plays tall through his patterns. Route work lacks crisp breaks and overall focus. HIs route fakes are unconvincing and won't get cornerbacks tilted in the wrong direction very often. Telegraphs double moves badly. Seem to be on different pages with his quarterback too often. Long speed is average and has trouble shaking cornerbacks on vertical routes. Will need to learn how to set up cornerbacks to create workable separation in NFL. Despite his size, wasn't asked to block very often for Hogs.", Round 6, Jaelen Strong," He has good size, but not great. He's not the fastest receiver and his routes don't do their job often enough. With that said, Hatcher has something to him. He plays with good balance and strength in his routes and flashes elevated focus when finishing catches in traffic. Hatcher has the athleticism to work intermediate and deep and could become a factor after a couple seasons of seasoning."
Krishawn Hogan,WR," Very good size with athletic, muscular build. Touchdown juggernaut with 56 over the last two seasons alone. Good concentration when tracking the deep ball. Has long arms and big hands for extended catch radius and can adjust to throws behind his frame. Lauded for competitive mental makeup and work ethic in the offseason. Good athletic ability after the catch. Used near the goal line in direct-snap plays.", Overwhelmed inferior level of competition on lower level. Will have to prove at the combine that he has the deep speed to gain vertical separation. Will need to polish route work for improved separation against NFL talent. Allows deep balls to come to him rather than consistently leaping and high-pointing., Round 4-5,," Big, dominant target who overwhelmed his level of competition on a regular basis for three seasons at Marian. Touchdowns and production have come easy for Hogan, but life in an NFL camp will be a substantial leap forward in competition that may take some time to adjust to. While he has NFL size, he needs to prove he also possesses NFL speed and/or quickness to uncover and produce."
Mack Hollins,WR," Will have a team drooling over his size and speed. Propels himself down the field with smooth, long strides. Chomps up cushion and glides past corners and safeties before they know what hit them. Legitimate vertical threat who finished with 20 touchdowns on just 71 catches. Dangerous run-after-catch ability in on deep crossing routes and slants. Former walk-on who still has a desire to do whatever it takes. Special teams captain all four years at school. Had 20 special teams tackles over his first three seasons and offers punt and kick cover value on special teams.", Played less than 50 percent of the offensive snaps in every season. Primarily used to stretch the field and doesn't have experience with a variety of routes. Still very raw. One speed route-runner who wins with just speed. Routes need more purpose. Not a natural hands catcher. Never produced more than 35 catches in a single season. Play strength through his patterns is below average and he can be re-routed. Leggy in underneath work and can be slow in and out of his breaks. Stalk-blocker who needs to give much better effort in run game., Round 4-5,," Hollins has four things that teams will look for on Day 3 of the draft -- height, weight, speed and special teams ability. Taller receivers usually need a longer runway for their build-up speed, but Hollins appears to be able to access his top gear relatively early which makes him such a dangerous deep threat considering his above average height. Hollins' ability to cover both punts and kicks should give him early work as he continues to learn the receiver position. Hollins has WR3 potential."
Hayden Hunt,P," Four-year punter. Will dabble with rugby punts, but has talent as a base punter. Able to hit the ball with desired hang time when he's punting for placement. Consistent punter whose yards per punt rarely fluctuated from year to year. Has hit almost 48 percent of his punts inside the 20-yard line over last two seasons.", Operation time can be way too slow. Has had three punts blocked in his career. Has a bad habit of shuffling feet and taking excess baby steps after catching a low snap. Fair catch totals are a little lower than desired., FA,," Highly experienced with 230 punts under his belt, Hunt is an accomplished base punter with the ability to hit the ball with decent distance and hang time. Hunt will need to speed up his operation time if he gets his shot in the pros."
Cameron Johnston,P," Has some experience (and training) as a conventional punter. Produced solid fair catch percentage when allowed to hang the ball for placement. Struck the ball with very good consistency this year, eliminating most shanks. Averaged 46.7 yards per kick in 2016. His net of 43.9 was second in college football. Has hit at least one 70-plus yard punt in three of four seasons.", Rugby style is his primary operation as a kicker. Will have to prove he can kick conventionally and with hang time. Never averaged hang time over four seconds over last three seasons. Can eliminate some touchbacks., Round 7-PFA,," Rugby style kickers simply don't translate well to the NFL because the league doesn't employ that system, but Johnston has a shot. As a placement kicker, he has displayed decent hang time and a functional operational time to get rid of the kick. The combine gives him a shot to show he's more than just a rubgy punter."
D.J. Jones,DT," Has a big bubble and plays with a wide base. Outrageous weight room strength with monster numbers in clean, bench, and squat. Plays low and fires upward strikes to elevate the blocker's center of gravity. Has the play strength to rip through an edge once he gets to it. Has quick hands and is nice with the swim move. Has necessary play traits to be an effective rusher in the twist game. Rare reactive athleticism and short-area lateral quickness for an interior player. Extended tackle radius allows him to close out running lanes away from his gap. Keeps hounding runners down the field for the tackle. Instinctive and quickly sniffs out screen passes. Very rarely on ground."," Has a stocky frame with short arms and lacks the length teams like. Lack of size could be an issue against NFL double teams. Motor gets him too juiced at times. Needs to gather himself to prevent running past his target. Was unable to overpower strong guards in man-to-man contest. Productivity fell way off over the second half of the season. Despite his impressive athleticism, lacked impact tackle production.", Round 4-5, Grady Jarrett," Jones has a freaky combination of power and athleticism that isn't seen all that often. While his playing style is reminiscent of Grady Jarrett's, keep in mind that he's a bigger player. Despite his impressive play attributes, Jones failed to generate the production that his flashes on tape would indicate he's capable of. If a coach can unlock more consistency, Jones has a chance to flourish as a one-gapping nose with three-down ability."
George Kittle,TE, Has broad shoulders and waist with a durable frame. Plays in pro-style attack and approaches blocking like an offensive lineman. Comes off the ball with good pad level and strikes with leverage and hands inside opponent's frame. Blocks with good technique and has footwork to get to reach blocks and combos. Hands are confident and sure with just one drop against 48 catches. Able to make sudden body adjustments to poorly thrown balls. Flashes vertical speed to become a seam worker. Physical runner after the catch with more wiggle than you would expect., Patterns are inconsistent and he rarely tilts defenders at the top of his routes. Could generate better separation with improved route leverage. Route breaks can be too easy to decipher. Plays fast but seems to be missing separation burst coming out of his breaks. Needs to work back to the ball harder in space. Allows defenders a pathway to the throw rather than sealing them out of the passing lane. Has tendency to keep weight too far forward as run blocker creating opportunity for defender to pull him off-balance., Round 4, Charles Clay, H-back type who lacks the desired size for in-line blocking but certainly has the technique and willingness to do it. He has good hands and flashes an ability to challenge as a pass catcher on all three levels. Kittle has the athleticism and blocking ability to become an effective move tight end if paired in the right system.
Trevor Knight,QB," Looks the part with a muscular, athletic build. Has the ability to hurt teams with his legs or extend plays outside of the pocket before striking downfield. May possess packaged play potential with zone-read capabilities on short yardage. Able to generate velocity on intermediate throws. Kept a clean sheet on his short passing attempts with 10 touchdowns and no interceptions.", One of the least accurate starting quarterbacks in college last season. Operates in the pocket with an excessively wide base as a passer. Has an elongated pitcher's windup and his arm slot drops down slightly below a three-quarter release. Location of his throws is a coin-flipper from snap to snap. Struggles mightily to attack outside the hashes. Lacks anticipation as a passer and allows defensive backs to close out throwing windows., UDFA,," Knight is a tough guy and a very capable runner, but he's never thrown with any functional accuracy and he doesn't have the anticipation and delivery quickness necessary. Knight is a longshot to make an NFL roster."
Javarius Leamon,OL," Could use more work in the weight room, but has an NFL frame with good length. In general, does a pretty good job of playing to his length, Shoots a well-timed inside hand as his initial punch. Will generate some push when firing into his down blocks. Plays with adequate body control in all of his movements. Had enough radar on the second level to find and land on his targets.", Lacks foot quickness to handle edge speed or redirect his weight and catch inside moves. Defaults to waist-bending at the top of the pass rush after rather than continuing to work his feet. Lacks power and authority in his hands. Has issues sustaining blocks for very long. Leaves his feet behind his pads as drive blocker limiting his balance and block sustain. Lacks functional recovery ability when beaten. Pass rushers can play through his inside post., PFA,," Leamon has the physical traits that will get the attention of NFL evaluators, but the tape shows a player lacking in foot quickness, hand strength and technique. The technique can be worked on, but the lack hand strength, upper body power and foot quickness could be hard to overcome. Leamon is a developmental project who could need a year on practice squad before he's ready to challenge for a roster spot."
Mitch Leidner,QB," Possesses NFL size with broad shoulders, good strength in his lower half, and big hands. Has experience under center and in a pro-style attack. Can roll left or right and throws with squared shoulders. Good ball-handling in his play-fakes and can throw with adequate touch on the long balls. Gets rid of the ball rather than taking the sack. Will stand in and take the hit to deliver his throw. Competitive runner and good decision-maker when asked to operate zone-reads. Logged 33 rushing touchdowns over his four-year career.", Intermediate accuracy was very poor. Stares down his targets allowing linebackers and safeties to jump the throws early. Set-up and release are too slow which tends to neutralize field-side anticipation throws. Inconsistent at leading receivers. Had underthrown deep balls rob him of long touchdown passes. Too hesitant to cut the ball loose and challenge safeties over the top. Finished with just 37 pass attempts of 21-plus yards. Velocity is below average and throws tend to nose-dive. Muscles his throws with upper-body. Pats ball pre-delivery., UDFA,," Leidner has NFL size and has some traits that warrant a trip into camp, but he lacks timing, decision-making and confidence as a passer. Leidner doesn't seem to have an advanced feel for his game-plan post snap and that tends to limit him to checkdowns and too many contested throws. In the end, he's more likely a camp invite than legitimate NFL backup."
Corey Levin,OL, Has big hands with good strength in them. Hand placement in running game is solid and consistent. Fluid in his lateral movement. Operates with desired foot quickness and body control both laterally and when working up to the second level. Athletic in space. Has ability to adjust his blocks against moving targets and can handle screen blocking responsibilities. Patient with a compact punch that has some pop behind it. Hands and feet work in unison. Very aware against twists and does a good job of passing and catching them., Needs to be faster with his hands. Has a little bit of a wind-up in his punch. Got consistently behind in the rep against Alabama defenders who were beating him in race for first hands-on. Does too much leaning and not enough lifting through his hips after initial contact. Can improve his recovery ability with better footwork rather than just trying to hang with hands. Doesn't have the drive strength to get much movement as a drive blocker against talented opposition., Round 7-PFA,," Levin would benefit from additional weight and muscle on his frame, but he does have tools to work with. He has enough athletic ability to fit with a team who wants to get their guards into space and he might have enough functional balance and core strength to hold up as a base blocker. If Levin can snap and give a team center/guard roster flexibility, he should increase his chances of sticking on a roster."
William Likely,DB," Quick-twitch athlete with springy feet. Has feet and balance to transition his movement in any direction without losing his quickness. Elite lateral quickness should allow him to soak up shifty slot receivers out of their release. Able to mirror and match complex routes. Has instant burst to restrict throwing windows. Plays with plus instincts and anticipation and rarely takes false steps. Always looking to take a path to throw rather than defaulting to the receiver. Has feisty play demeanor. Extremely competitive and plays with a great deal of confidence. Will chop, scrape and dig at the ball to disrupt the catch. Will circumvent perimeter blockers and get after running backs and wide receiver screens as close to the backfield as possible. Outstanding talent as both a punt and kick returner."," Extremely short for the position. Will get big-boyed in space when posted up. Teams will likely look for ways to match him up against size on the next level. Will take the worst of it when trying to tackle big running backs headed downhill towards him. Has had injuries to his ankle, shoulder and now his knee (ACL tear). His size raises obvious durability concerns. His aggressiveness will make him a target for out-and-ups and Sluggo (slant-and-go) routes. Will lose sight of running plays, at times, when he hyper-focuses on his slot coverage.", Round 6-7, Tavon Young," It is impossible to ignore Likely's diminutive stature and it's impossible to ignore the fact that he's having to come back from an ACL tear. It's equally impossible to ignore his elite quickness and hyper-competitive nature. His lack of size will put a ceiling on his draft stock, but Likely is talented enough to become a slot corner in the NFL. His ability to take over return duties should add value for a player who can make a team better regardless of what the tape measure says."
T.J. Logan,RB, Contain-buster who has a nitrous gear that rockets him to and around the corner on sweeps. Accesses top gear quickly when bursting downhill and can make defenses feel it if he's untouched into second level. Has rhythmic feet to make directional changes without much change in his pace. Decent lateral quickness in his cuts. Has some toughness in him. Willing to drop his shoulder and challenge cornerbacks and safeties when finishing his run. Offers third down value. Can sort through defensive fronts and find his protection responsibility. Able to split out or can match-up linebackers with wheel routes. Had just one drop against 66 catches over last three years. Exciting kick return talent who can change the momentum of a game. Hits his top speed early and looks to get it downhill quickly., Change-of-pace running back who lacks desired size to play through contact. Won't be able to create additional yardage with lower body power. Vision and feel is just average as an interior runner. Will choose the wrong path and dash into traffic. Needs a clearly defined running lane to unleash him. Tends to keep runs play-side and needs to play with better vision for cutback lanes. Could be typecast as a scat-back who needs to work from gun formation packages. Fumble rate over last two seasons of once every 37 carries is a concern. Can be too loose with the ball carrying it away from his body., Round 5-6, Akeem Hunt," Sleek athlete with excellent short area burst and the finishing speed to hit home runs in all three phases if the opportunity is right. Logan will likely be considered flex player on the roster who can compete for duties as a kick returner and third down back. While he lacks size to handle the heavy lifting as a running back, his play speed should not be discounted."
Shalom Luani,S, Two-year production including 157 tackles and eight interceptions will catch your eye. Former soccer player with good balance and footwork in space. Displays good reactive quickness in his transition to the football. Excels in zone coverage underneath. Plays with good route anticipation and will jump the routes. Reads quarterbacks and is willing to break off coverage and overlap into another area to make a play on the ball. Has timing and hands to make consistent plays on the football when he's in position.," Teams will have trouble trusting him as a tackler. Has been tagged with 31 missed tackles and 11 broken tackles allowed in just two seasons. Instincts against the run are below average and he'll take poor angles to the ball. Too eager to fill rather than waiting for running back to commit to a run lane. Not a form tackler. Needs a more square-up, wrap-up approach. Loses track of deep ball responsibilities, at times, when asked to play on the back end.", PFA,," Luani has the ball production and enough flashes on tape that scouts will be forced to keep him alive in their draft meetings. While Luani showed some improvement as a tackler, Washington State was forced to protect him by playing him in more underneath zone where he was able to cover and not worry about being the last line of defense. Luani likely needs to get his start as a special teams cover man, but without fundamental tackling, that could be a challenge."
JoJo Mathis,OLB, Has experience standing and with hand in the ground. Has ankle flexion to bend and corner when attacking around the edge. Good forward lean and arm extension gives him effective starting point for speed-to-power rush. Plays with an edge. Used time recovering from foot injury to begin to reshape his body. Flashes good upper body strength when setting an edge. Able to ragdoll finesse tight ends around. Has hands and power to work from block to block when shedding and searching for the ball. Instincts are above average. Makes quick diagnosis against screens and zone-reads. Marriage and birth of his child have provided stability and maturity., On the short side with below average arm length. Has limited amounts of tape and production. Body composition is below average. Soft in his lower body and through his midsection. Missing explosive get-off to consistently threaten an NFL edge. Needs a more developed pass rush attack including a formidable counter. Moves like he's wearing heavy shoes. Lacks quick-twitch and bouncy feet for sudden change of direction. Pursuit quickness needs work. Maturity issues have plagued him for much of his career. Missed much of the season with a foot injury that will have to pass the combine medicals., PFA,," Mathis doesn't have the length or the pass rush skills to play at defensive end so he will likely be considered as a 3-4 outside backer only. Mathis lacks the athleticism and twitch that teams want from their rush linebacker, but he does have some physicality and edge strength to battle against the run. Mathis could go on Day 3, but his ceiling could be as a serviceable backup unless he really refines his rush game and adds more quickness."
Art Maulet,DB, Showed immense improvement in coverage from last year to now. Understands speed limitations and does a better job of protecting himself. Has decent press mechanics. Can match receivers across the field out of their release. Reads quarterback and shadows his eyes from zone. Always looking to creep on throws underneath when playing off. Good arm length and hand size for his frame. Explosive leaper. Can challenge and defeat much taller receivers in defending the high-point throw. Takes a direct line to the ball in challenging the catch. Good hand-eye coordination helps him swipes throws away. Shows some grit as a tackler.," Has a history of getting torched on the deep throw. Struggles with acceleration after opening hips to sprint with receivers down the field. Allows insurmountable separation if he's not diligent in his retreat. Aggressive, ball-hawking style underneath opens him to damage over the top. Can be big-boyed in space by bigger targets. Shows slight delay in reaction quickness when attempting to break on the ball from a backpedal or shuffle.", PFA,," Maulets size will require him to move inside to the slot where his athleticism and ball skills are a plus. While Maulet was a much better football player this season and clearly understood how to play his position better, he will need to run well at the combine for teams to consider drafting him. He should post some athletic numbers, but since hes just 5-foot-9, he needs to prove that he can hit a functional top speed."
Bradley Northnagel,LS,,,,,
Ifeadi Odenigbo,DL," Burly build with good power in his lower half and grown-man strength in his play. Bonafide ""Mr. Bull-rush"" off the edge. Bends knees into contact to work under a tackle's pads. Will land a long-arm stab or a two-hand push and then drive from his hips to walk tackles back into the quarterback. Began to flash an effective counter-spin back inside once he hit the top of his rush arc. Has the play strength to reduce inside as a rusher and fight through redirect blocks on the edge. Needs technique work, but has the strength to battle at the point of attack as run defender.", Used primarily as a pass rushing specialist. Career production against the run was disappointing. Needs to learn how to set a stronger edge to help contain against the run. Allows tight ends to stay connected to him for too long as blockers. Missing stride length and upfield burst to carry him up and around the corner as a rusher. Very limited selections on his pass rush menu. Too content to sustain a bull rush rather than improve his standing with coordinated effort between his feet and hands., Round 5-6,," He's not a skilled pass rusher, but his power and developing spin move are traits worth working with. Odenigbo produced a quarterback pressure rate higher than Sam Hubbard, Taco Charlton and Garrett Sickels. Odenigbo will need to prove he can handle some run-stopping duties or sticking around for very long could be tough since he's not a classic edge-bending specialist."
Zach Pascal,WR," Showed consistent growth and production as a player. Took on a high percentage of offensive touches as both a receiver and a runner. Routes feature a sharp stick-and-stem at his break to create a quick throwing window for quarterbacks. Hands-catcher who snatches it away from his body unless he needs to secure in traffic. Good awareness to drop feet in bounds near sideline. On deep balls, has a good feel for where defensive backs are and will stack them on his hip and hold them there while he prepares to make the catch. High-point deep ball skills with ability to create some late separation with his body.", Plays with a duck-footed running style. Long strider off the line of scrimmage. Could struggle to find the foot quickness necessary to shake free of press coverage. Needs a long runway to build up his play speed. Is a little slow getting in and out of his breaks. Lacking the route sharpness to uncover against NFL-caliber cornerbacks. Level of competition did not prepare him for the athletes and speed he will be facing on Sunday., Round 7-PFA,, Three-year starter whose consistency of production was on one of the catalysts behind Old Dominion's successful 2016. Pascal has decent size and ball skills but his routes and separation are just okay. His combine workout could go a long way in determining whether or not he gets drafted. He's returned kicks at Old Dominion so that could be a side door into an early roster spot.
Hayden Plinke,TE," Good build with well-proportioned frame. Was heavily targeted over the last two seasons as a possession tight end. Able to work in-line, from the slot and as a move tight end. Has some straight-line speed when he has a long runway to work with. Able to outrun some linebackers on drag routes. The more space he has to operate with, the more separation he can create. Plays big over the middle and can handle punishing hits and can dish them out after the catch. Has some spunk as a blocker. Willing to mix it up all the way through the whistle. Works hard to try and sustain blocks and has potential to get better."," Hand-eye coordination is below average. Allows the ball to beat him up as a pass catcher and had seven drops over last two seasons. Uncovered thanks to drag routes, misdirection and shallow crossing routes. A little slow getting into his routes and out of his breaks. Doesn't have the twitch to accelerate out of his breaks for early separation. Catch radius is below average and he needs balls thrown to his frame. Hand placement and punch is below average as a blocker.", Round 6-7, Luke Stocker," Plinke has good meat on his bones, but he's not as tall and long as teams would typically like out of their Y-tight end. He's a competitive enough blocker in the run game that he could become a player who helps in that area in time. His hands are below average and he will need to improve as a route-runner, but he has enough athleticism and straight line speed to go along with his blocking to make him a late Day 3 pick with a shot to make a roster."
Michael Rector,WR," Has the vertical juice necessary to force cornerbacks into a hasty retreat. Is able to open up his stride length and chomp up cushion quickly to race past defenders and into open space. Speed creates opportunities for easy opening on deep outs and intermediate, in-breaking routes. Despite inconsistencies with hands, is able to secure a strongly contested catch from time to time. Will give an honest effort as a blocker."," Early with his head turn into route breaks telegraphing his intentions. Has struggled with drops in three of his four years at Stanford. Inconsistent catching the easy, leading throw outside his frame. Almost never catches the point of the ball and allows it into his frame. Straight-line speed merchant who lacks lateral agility. Doesn't have much wiggle after the catch and goes down too easily. Ball skills are below average down the field.", Round 7-PFA,," Rector has decent size and very good open field speed, but his hands are below average and he may not have the short area shake to create a clean release against press or adequate route separation underneath against tight man coverage. His ability to take the top off of the defense has to be noted, but he's more of a fast guy than an NFL wideout at this point."
Rushel Shell,RB," Plus athleticism for his size. Powerful build through his trunk, but hips are flexible and fluid. Has the feet to string together jukes and cuts to make multiple defenders miss near the line of scrimmage. Decisive with a see-and-go mentality and burst between the tackles. Intelligent runner who processes reads quickly while on the move. Has instincts and athletic ability to alter run path suddenly when it's called for. Has good ankle flexion and is able to make wide cuts away from angle tackles. Powerful lower half provides him balance and allows for greater contact balance. Able to absorb a blow and maintain his track. Able to make defenders miss in space on swing passes. Workload was moderate in college and there should still be plenty of tread left on the tires.", Will decelerate when gathering to deliver a second level blow. Let's his pad level rise when making cutbacks. Needs to keep run path downhill on second level and fight urge to bounce it outside against NFL speed. Had an issue with focus drops this season in passing game. Missed time due to concussion and ankle injury this season. Has dealt with some maturity issues in the past. Needs to work on connection rate and angles of his chip blocks. Can get antsy and lose his mirroring in pass protection., PFA, Juwan Thompson," The thick, compact frame says ""power runner"" but the reality is that Shell has the athleticism to make defenders miss in tight quarters and burst to get through traffic and onto the second level. Shell has posted consistent, but unspectacular numbers over his four years, but the tape shows a player who can run with adequate power, wiggle and quickness. Shell could become a quality NFL backup or committee running back."
Sojourn Shelton,CB," Four-year starter with excellent pattern recognition. Has talented feet. Ability to mirror-and-match receivers throughout the route is up there with Tre'Davious White from LSU. Eyes are balanced keying between the receiver and quarterback. If he sniffs a route break from off-coverage, he'll prepare to jump the route. Instinctive with lightning quick reaction time. Has closing burst to make a play on throws in front of him and long speed to check deep threats around the field. Willing to peel off of his coverage and range over to help play the ball or make a play on the pass catcher. Has the athletic ability to make the transition to full-time slot cornerback."," Undersized with thin lower body. Can be pushed around by bigger receivers through the route. Jump balls will be a challenge. Flagged with 15 pass interferences during career. Doesn't have length to contest as many throws as he could. Needs to turn and find the ball a hair sooner when back is to the quarterback. Poor tackler this season. Finesse player who doesn't get finishing pop behind pads. Can be erased from the play by physical, run-blocking receivers. Not a return man and too small to offer viable special teams cover value.", PFA,," Shelton is an athletic cover man with quick, talented feet to stay connected to routes, but he lacks the functional size and strength needed for his work outside of coverage. While he clearly has the speed, quickness and instincts to handle man and zone coverage, any tackling concerns will be exacerbated as teams look to target him over and over if he's on the field. Without special teams talent, making a roster will be much tougher, but he's not without a strong check-mark in the coverage department."
Pita Taumoepenu,OLB," Quick-twitch athlete with light, bouncing feet. Able to stick his foot in the ground and redirect quickly to mirror change of direction from running backs and quarterbacks. Always looks to crash down inside and catch ball-carrier before he hits the hole. Plays with terrific urgency and a motor that is always humming. Relentless in his pursuit with a good closing burst to the ball no matter where he is on the field. Good explosiveness out of his stance and into his rush. If he times-up snap, can race up the field and beat a tackle around the edge. Uses a well-timed inside counter when he senses his opponent has set far enough up the field. Second-effort sack man. Has attributes to potentially shine on special teams."," Undersized for the edge. Lacks upper body power and overall play strength to set a strong edge and will get caught inside losing contain responsibilities at time. When tackles clamp into his frame, he is unlikely to unhinge in a timely fashion. Has no chance of channeling speed-to-power as a pass rusher. Pass rush plan is lacking. Face-up rushing style will require cleaner hand usage to create some openings. Ducks head into contact as a tackler and allows too many broken tackles. Carries very little thud behind his pads as a tackler and is forced into wrap and drag finishing. Has just seven career starts.", Round 7-PFA,," Pass rush specialist with limited exposure to the game who has posted consistent sack and pressure production throughout his career thanks to his athleticism and motor. He's undersized and lacks the strength to factor in as an every-down 3-4 OLB option, but he does have a chance to become a backup rush linebacker and might even warrant consideration as a 4-3 WILL who can step into a special teams role quickly."
Nate Theaker,OG, Good overall size for a move inside. Has started at both tackle spots and at right guard. Fairly light on his feet when mirroring in pass protection. Teams may view him as an emergency tackle option in case of injury. Has decent upper body strength. Does a good job of approaching his block under control and framing it up at the point of attack., Doesn't unlock hips when drive blocking. Plays with an elevated pad level. Unable to bend and move laterally well enough to get his reach blocks taken care of. Plays with inconsistent base width that affects his contact balance. Needs to operate with better angles to improve his block security. Loses track of hand placement allowing them to slide outside the frame., PFA,," Theaker has the necessary physical dimensions to move from tackle to guard, but his lack of bend and inability to play with leverage and hip torque could derail his chances of sticking on a roster."
Noel Thomas,WR," Displays some early speed in his get-off against off-man coverage. Has experience lining up inside and outside. At his best working in the seam and over the middle from the slot. Ball skills can be impressive depending on the game you watch. The more challenging the catch, the more elevated the ball skills become. Despite slightly shorter arms, gets every inch of extension from them when pulling in the high throw or diving for a deep pass. Makes well-timed adjustments to work into catch position on back shoulder throws. Has some ""yards after catch"" talent down when he's allowed to stride in open space.", Short stepper. Has to take twice as many steps to work around press coverage. Gets caught and jammed by stiff jabs from aggressive press corners. Upright and rounded at his break points. Salesmanship in his route fakes is severely lacking. Cornerbacks will often run his routes for him. Needs to maintain vertical speed rather than gearing down to find ball. Lacks separation talent and defenders usually stationed nearby. Has just six touchdown catches over last 267 targets. Hands can go from impressive to lackluster in an instant., Round 7-PFA,," Thomas has pretty good NFL size, but his route running is poor allowing defensive backs to jump his routes far too often. Thomas' issues getting off of press coverage is a concern and he'll likely have to try and make the league as a big slot receiver. His highlight reel catchers are nice window dressing, but he needs to catch the ball with more consistency and work on the nuances of the position."
Michael Tyson,S," Wrap-up tackler who lands chest first and drags ball carriers down quickly. Good finishing rate as a tackler and doesn't let many slip away. Attacks downhill once he diagnoses run. Prefers to meet running backs and receiver screens in the backfield when possible. Has experience covering the slot and playing zone underneath. Plays with adequate route anticipation. If receiver gives route away prematurely, he will respond. Defends throws with well-timed inside hand to disrupt catch point. Communicative on the field and plays with football intelligence.", Hip tightness makes it hard to handle coverage in space. Defense allowed him to sit down in relatively small patch of grass to do much of his work. Slight hesitation in his downhill close-outs to the throw. Much better playing forward than backward. Slow to flip hips and run with any speed. Allows too much vertical separation on go routes. Tends to get lost when back is to the quarterback. Slow to get head around and find the football allowing receivers to make necessary adjustments. All five of his interceptions came in two games., PFA,," Plays with pretty good football instincts and is competitive challenging the run, but his inconsistencies in deep coverage could cause teams to shy away from using him anywhere but near the line of scrimmage. Tyson has average safety skills and could benefit with more weight work if he has to become a full-time box safety with tight end coverage ability."
Conrad Ukropina,K,,,,,
Tanner Vallejo,LB, Team-first player who played through severe wrist pain for almost the entire season. Sophomore season proved how productive he could be when allowed to play in the middle. Instinctive and quick to anticipate play flow. Takes aggressive contain angle when needed. Has a good feel for most efficient path to the ball. Maintains run fits and looks to spill the ball wide whenever possible. Plays with reactive athleticism to break down and quickly redirect his weight into runners trying to cut back. Shows a willingness to take on lead blockers with a leveraged shoulder. Good play speed with range to chase from sideline to sideline. Athletic enough to handle deep Cover-2 drops if called on., Angular frame with very short arms and may not be able to carry much more functional mass. Has never matched production total from two seasons ago. Below average play strength. Will struggle to unlock from a strong punch and fight back into the play. Could have issues leveraging his gap in the NFL. Can be washed away if he doesn't trigger downhill and stay one step ahead of blockers. Lacks thud behind his pads as a hitter. Has had issues sliding off of tackles. Has had to deal with injuries over the last two seasons and had to shut it down this season due to worsening of his wrist injury suffered in September., Round 7-PFA, Dominique Alexander," Vallejo's outstanding production his sophomore season is one of the things keeping him alive in scouting circles. From a physical standpoint, he's an undersized inside linebacker who lacks the long levers needed to keep offensive linemen off of him. His instincts and third-down ability are plusses, but he'll need to find the right 3-4 fit or attempt to move to an outside linebacker role in a 4-3. Vallejo has NFL backup potential."
Bobo Wilson,WR, Plays with awareness and quick feet near sideline to stick the catch. Flashes big burst into routes and generates desired vertical push to force cornerbacks into an aggressive retreat. Natural acceleration allows him to uncover quickly on underneath work and intermediate crossing routes. Route work should improve with more coaching and dedication. Has good body control to reach way back and pluck throws behind him. Willing and able to work the middle of the field. Has both kick and punt return experience., Has issues getting off of press coverage. Will need to improve his route-running. Doesn't have much hip sink into his breaks and tends to run rounded routes. Head-turner inside his route giving away his break direction. Cornerbacks are able to climb back into the pattern and challenge his catches. Hands are too inconsistent. Struggles to secure contested catches. Missed the last half of the season due to foot injury that will need to be cleared at combine., PFA,," Wilson is a slot receiver with the speed to attack the seam or work over the middle on the first and second levels. While his acceleration can create some separation for himself, his routes are too telegraphed and rounded to consistently shake defenders. His experience as both a punt and kick returner could give him the upper hand in a battle for a roster spot."
Bug Howard,WR, Big target with sure hands. Has just four drops over his four seasons at North Carolina. Finds open areas against zone and sits quickly while opening to find the pass. Willing to work middle of the field and can secure catch through contact. Gets in the way enough to make a difference as a blocker. Long frame can lock into cornerbacks and neutralizes them as a run blocker., Slow into his routes and could have issues countering press coverage. Tight-hipped in his movement. Looks awkward and unbalanced when attempting to sink into his breaks. Has no separation quickness out of his cuts and will have to wear tight man coverage like a sweater. Lacks functional speed to challenge corners who are squatting on his work underneath. Expected to run poorly at the combine., PFA,," Howard has the height and weight part, but is missing the speed and that could make finding a draft-day home a challenge. Howard is a possession receiver who can work in traffic and catch what is thrown to him, but he is unable to create enough separation with his routes. Howard's lack of special teams experience is another obstacle he may have to overcome to make a roster."
Drew Morgan,WR, Good initial speed into his route. Very clever at setting up routes and has a good feel for using speed variance in footwork to open door to separation against man coverage. Smooth short-area quickness gets him into and out of his breaks quickly. Rarely telegraphs route intentions. Extremely tough and willing to take the licks to make catch over the middle. Adjusts to throws behind him with relative ease and can hoover the low throw without breaking stride. Shifty runner after the catch with fakes that throw tacklers way off the mark. Has feet for sudden stops., Can be pushed around inside the route and knocked off-balance. Quality press coverage can stymie him at the line. Can't run past cornerbacks on a straight go route. Doesn't have big separation burst out of his breaks. Can improve his positioning to keep defensive backs out of the catch. Throws himself off-balance coming out of some of his route fakes. Gets open early but may not have the traits to be a consistent finisher down the field. Averaged just 10.8 yards per touch., PFA,," Has adequate size to give a team some snaps from an outside receiver spot, but the slot may be his final home. Morgan wins with crisp routes and sticky hands and there is plenty of tape showing the toughness to finish catches despite taking big hits. Morgan has the talent to earn a roster spot and work his way up the ladder, but he needs to show off good quickness numbers and adequate speed during his combine workout."
Cameron Lee,OG," Has long arms at the end of a well-proportioned, NFL-caliber frame. Always looking to finish his blocks when he's able to sustain. Will flash some edge to his play. Attempts to unlock hips and roll them into his run blocks. Plays with some upper body ""wrestling strength"" when it's time to maul. Pass sets with a wide base. Possesses natural anchor strength to battle back against bull-rush attempts. Sees and responds to twists. Keeps hands hanging in punch-ready position. Hands generally stay inside the frame of opponent.", Pops up too tall after the snap. Poor pad level robs him of low-man status and ability to generate drive-blocking power. Has heavy feet and is slow into second-level blocks. Unable to mirror athletic interior rushers smoothly. Straight-legged pass setter with poor change of direction quickness. Waist-bending and leaning into blocks is a common theme throughout the tape. Has problems with body control and balance. Over-sets on the edges and allows his weight to drift outside of his frame. Tends to lead with his upper body in all aspects of his game. Needs to play with faster hands., Round 6-7,," Lack of natural bend limits his power and he has below average athleticism, but Lee's size and physical traits are certain to appeal to teams who covet those strengths along the interior. He could become a career backup who could step into some snaps in the right situation."
Antony Auclair,TE, Possesses some high-end physical traits with long arms and massive hands. Well put-together with good muscular build throughout his frame. Capable in-line blocker who attacks his work with an edge. Lands with proper hand placement and torques hips into opponent at impact. Runs feet through contact for extended block sustain. Out of stance and into routes smoothly. Has separation quickness to challenge linebackers in coverage. Has speed to attack down the field and shows toughness to haul in combat catches., Has very limited exposure to quality competition. Still learning technique and fundamentals as a run blocker. Needs to take better angles on his lateral blocks. Will allow defensive ends to cross his face too often. More of a mauler than a technician at this point. Is a little too upright in his routes and could use more knee bend. Limited hip sink into his breaks and routes are somewhat rounded. Average run-after-catch ability in open field., Rounds 5-6, Anthony Fasano," Auclair gets check marks across the board for size, length and athleticism and it doesn't hurt that he plays with some edge as an in-line blocker. While the step up in competition will be substantial and could require an adjustment period, Auclair has all the tools to become a quality NFL backup with eventual starter traits if he reaches his potential."
Jake Eldrenkamp,OG," Good athlete. Plays with good bend and has easy, smooth movement skills. Shows off good lateral agility and quickness off the snap. Built for zone scheme. Has the feet to get to difficult reach blocks and work hips into place to seal his block. Able to stick defensive tackles on his inside shoulder and run his feet to keep them there. Takes quality angles up to second level. Hands are big and strong helping him sustain his blocks. Capable long- or short-pull blocker. Plays with good balance in pass sets and stays mirrored to defender. Pass punch lands inside and once he gets extension he keeps arms locked out.", Possesses relatively narrow frame and may have issues adding and maintaining desired mass for interior. Needs to play on the move. Struggles to generate quality push at the point of attack as base blocker. Hands can swing a little too wide in run game. Tends to lean and push rather than roll hips into his blocks. Will chase twisters too deep and run himself out of position to catch the looper., Round 7-PFA,," An athletic zone-scheme fit at guard or potentially center if he proves he can snap it. Eldrenkamp is technically sound in both the running and passing games and he's got desired body control and balance that zone teams like. The biggest question for him will be whether or not he can carry more mass, but the tape looks like that of a backup or possibly eventual starter if he can find the right scheme fit."
Taquan Mizzell,RB," Has frenetic feet that never stop. Can gather himself and make sharp, downhill cuts. Plays with plus vision and an awareness of backside lanes. Hips are on a swivel and allow for difficult changes of direction on all three levels. Elusive in the hole and can string moves together. Has agility to slide out of the side door when sudden traffic appears in the backfield. Plays at a consistent pace and has the acceleration to get to the corner on stretch plays. Unpredictable in his cuts. Comfortable in cozy running lanes and can pop out of the other side. Doesn't need wide-open points of entry and attack downhill. Quality weapon out of backfield. Gets separation out of his routes and has just two drops to 126 catches over last two years."," Is a little undersized to handle interior run game responsibilities on next level. Unable to generate meaningful yardage for himself after contact. Lacks power to drive through arm tackles and play balanced through contact. Juke junkie will occasionally fake himself into an unbalanced position. Will need to run with less wasted motion when setting up fakes as a pro. At times, gets too anxious to find cutback lanes rather than settling into an outside track. Rarely asked to square up and take on blitzers. Ball security is below average.", Round 7-PFA,," Shifty outside zone fit who played in a pro-style rushing attack in 2015. Mizzell runs with plus vision and plays with the desired pace and wiggle of a runner looking to exploit fluid running lanes along the perimeter. He is undersized as an early down back, but might be able to find work as a change-of-pace runner with good elusiveness and an ability to make plays out of the backfield as a pass catcher."
Tion Green,RB," Big frame, but not overly bulky. Has ability to run to his size with good collision balance. Tough runner who spent a majority of his carries between the tackles. Can tear through arm tackles and averaged more yards after contact than before contact. Possesses adequate vision and makes good reads on outside zone plays. Has nimble, one-cut footwork to stick and go downhill. Able to make sharp cuts with good ankle flexion. Route running matters to him. Has ability out of backfield and can gain separation out of breaks against linebackers. Flashes some ability in pass protection. Has coverage ability on special teams.", Production has been below average in college. Lacks explosiveness. Playing style lends itself to a grinder mentality. Lacks the functional speed to consistently beat flowing linebackers around the corner. Face-up runner with difficulties getting skinny through tight quarters. Decisiveness and pace of his runs will both have to accelerate. Premature finisher who looks to cover and duck his helmet rather than seek out additional moves on second level. Runs between tackles like he's afraid to fumble., Round 7-PFA,," When the rubber hits the road, Green is going to be more of a grinder than a creator as a runner. With that said, he does have good foot quickness and he's not a tight-hipped runner, so he might be a fit for a team looking for a big, one-cut runner. Green isn't going to make defenders miss that often, but he does flash some three-down potential and could make a 53-man roster if he can pull his weight on special teams."
Michael Clark,WR," Intriguing combination of size and speed. Former college basketball player with foot quickness to create some shake in his release against press coverage. Has some smoothness to his route stems that creates sudden separation on post routes. Flashes talent and potential to get substantially better with more coaching. Long frame and high point ability makes him a potentially dangerous target on fade routes. Tape shows a natural ability to track the deep throw. Has good buildup speed to create some separation on deep balls. Plays with necessary body control for adjustment to throws outside his frame. Despite his inexperience, displays a tendency to work back to the ball.", Played just one year of college football after playing just his freshman year of football in high school. Needs to improve hand fighting for cleaner press release. Has much of the route tree still to learn. Routes are ragged and need extensive work. Needs to allow route-breaks. Doesnt always open in catch-ready position out of short and intermediate routes. Caught just 42 percent of his targets. Struggled with hand consistency -- especially on contested catches. Needs to improve play strength. Still learning how to utilize size to his advantage. Too reliant upon height and leaping to win 50/50 throws. Avoids blocking unless absolutely necessary. Play demeanor lacks urgency and competitiveness at times., PFA,," It's hard to label Michael Clark as an ascending prospect with just one year of college football under his belt, but he does have the size/speed traits that will earn him the attention of NFL teams. He is more of a project at this point considering the improvements needed in route-running and with his contested catches. Clark is a prime candidate to end up on a practice squad while teams coach him up and sort through his potential."
Keion Adams,OLB, Basketball background is evident in his play. Feet are light and bounding. Rarely false steps out of his stance and into his rush. Always works to an edge against blockers. Makes it extremely difficult for tackles to mirror him. Rarely allows a square punch into his chest. Has loose hips to flip around the edge like a basketball defender working over a screen. Has the fluidity and flexibility for tight cornering as pass rusher. Inside counter spin is a dangerous weapon he can feature more. Features big closing burst to the ball as a rusher and in pursuit of ball carriers. Has quickness out of stance to shoot gaps and stink up the backfield. Diagnoses wide flowing runs quickly and climbs over the top of tight ends racing ahead to maintain contain on the edge., Lacks ideal size and length on the edge. Can be engulfed by size and driven off his position. Will need to fight back against wash down blocks on the move. Lacks consistent hand usage at point of attack and as a rusher. Needs to learn to become better hand fighter at the top of his rush. Missing a go-to counter move. Will have to improve punch-and-shuck technique when taking on blocks. Willingness to work around blocks on the edge could create wider running lanes for NFL running games. Scouts have some concerns over character red flags., Rounds 5-6, Arthur Moats," Adams is an elusive pass rusher who wins with athleticism and foot quickness, but who may lack the size and length to be considered an every-down edge player in a 3-4 front. Adams has pursuit quickness around the field and can be very disruptive when allowed to shoot gaps against the run, but he will have to prove he can set a strong edge and hold his ground at the point of attack if he wants to become anything more than a situational rusher."
Grover Stewart,DT," Powerful, NFL-ready frame with thick lower half and evenly displaced weight throughout. Jolts opponents with good initial pop that can knock blockers off their spots. Carries brute force in upper body with natural anchor to fight back against double teams. Showed off impressive straight line speed at his pro day. Athletic big man who will coast on blocks before flashing eye-opening reactive quickness disengaging and making tackles when runners try to race through his gaps. Bull-rush specialist able to create some pocket cave once he starts rolling downhill.", Needs to play with better coordination between hands and feet. Lacks consistent feel for down blocks and double teams. Can be a little slow to set his anchor. Pad level is too tall. Improved bend and leverage would help generate more consistent results at point of attack. Rolls into initial contact rather than crowding and working with a quick punch-and-control technique. Raw and unskilled as a hand fighter. Slow to discard smaller blockers and allows them longer rides than they deserve. Face-up rusher lacking the upper body flexion and go-to move to slither into backfield., Rounds 5-6, Deon Simon," Stewart's girth, power and potential could lead a team to take him on the third day as a developmental run-stuffer capable of playing on the nose or at three-technique. Stewart is still very raw, but additional technique work could unleash a much more capable interior defender as he has the traits. The jump in competition will take some time to adjust to, but like other small school interior defenders before him, Stewart has the potential to work himself into a more prominent role within the first two or three years."
Tarean Folston,RB," Well built with the frame to handle physical play of the NFL. Good athlete with fluid hips and desired foot quickness. Has ability to make sudden cuts downhill from outside zone.  Has the base to balance through contact, break tackles and spin into additional yardage. Will drop his shoulder and bring some pop behind his pads when he's ready to finish. Has experience in a variety of run schemes. Hands are soft and reliable in passing game. Used on hitches, swing passes and slip screens.", Vision is below average. Looked hesitant at times this season after tearing ACL and missing 2015 season. Allows an early running lane to go unused. Missing feel and instincts when running between the tackles. Will decelerate into contact at times. Inconsistent play speed. Looks like he can access more RPMs and will need to on the next level. Below average at setting up tacklers for the slip on the second level. Predictable runner when flowing outside and rarely entices linebackers out of their fits with his running style., PFA,," Folston has the size and athleticism for the NFL game and he appears to have the hands to be considered for a role as a third-down option. Folston's vision isn't great and while he can create for himself with some power, he'll primarily get what is blocked for him. If he shows he is willing to get some tackles on special teams early in his career, he might find his way onto a depth chart since he should be a more confident runner in Year 2 of his ACL recovery."
Tim White,WR, Collegiate triple-jumper with good speed and great explosiveness. Plays fast when attacking down the field. Early accelerator off the line of scrimmage and runs with a smooth gait. Has ability to hit second gear and climb over cornerback. Tape shows a quality ball tracker able to adjust his route and body to the throw. Has unusually large hands for his size. Bouncy feet help trigger quick escapes when challenged by press corners. Operates with good foot quickness in and out of his breaks with a whip route that can put cornerbacks in a trailing position. Talented return man with two years of experience as both a kick and punt returner at Arizona State.," Frame is a little lanky and lacking desired play strength. Scouts question his ability to secure throws in the noise over the middle. Tabbed with 11 drops over the last two seasons. Utilized more on first and third levels. Lacks experience of complex, intermediate routes. Utilized as catch-and-run option, but was unable to fight through arm tackles consistently enough with the ball in his hands. Doesn't appear to have sudden, lateral burst to get away from coverage and hit the home run on punt returns.", Round 7-PFA,," White is a slot wide receiver with the vertical speed and ball skills to occasionally push out wide and challenge down the field. He could use more play strength and will almost assuredly get challenged by a more physical brand of cornerback than he saw in at Arizona State. While his return ability gives his draft stock a bump, his tape also shows a measure of natural talent as a receiver who can create some separation. If he finds the right team fit, White could carve out a role as a fourth or fifth receiver and return man."
Brad Seaton,OT, Three-year starter with surprising lateral quickness and agility for such a tall player. Patient on the move and takes good angles to reach defenders outside shoulder on play-side zone. Uses consistent footwork to mirror and sustain his blocks on the move. Has body control to handle work-up assignments to linebackers on combo blocks. Will adjust his second level assignment and find work when his initial target is out of range. Good balance leads to easier redirects inside against stunts and twists. Displays adequate anchor against bull-rushers., Quickness of kick-slide is average. Could have trouble handling left tackle pass pro responsibilities in NFL. Punch rhythm is predictable and can be timed up by a studious defensive end. Will need to improve his play strength to help him do a better job of redirecting defenders when they get to his edges. Hands tend to land a little wide and his punch lacks snap. Height forces him into disadvantage from leverage standpoint. Plays with too much waist-bending as run blocker in attempt to lower pad level. Struggles to create push as drive blocker., Rounds 6-7,," There are a handful of very tall tackles with good athleticism in this draft, but most of the others lack a functional anchor to hold up against power. Seaton isn't a power player, but he appears to have enough natural core strength to project as a swing tackle best-suited to the right side. His ability to operate on the move could appeal to zone running teams."
Cole Croston,OT, Has good frame and above average length. Plays with desired hand strength. Can snatch the frame of defender and sustain his block with hand strength and body control. Has experience at both tackle positions. Zone block specialist. Comes out of stance and gets into lateral movement quickly. Consistently finds his target on work-up blocks to second level and can adjust to moving targets. Takes smart angles to his blocks. Recognizes twists and blitzes and responds early., Doesn't sink and sit down when throwing his punch in pass pro. Starts hands a little wide and punch lacks pop. Core strength is a big concern. Took way too many losses against Northwestern defensive end Ifeadi Odenigbo getting ragged dolled around in protection. Has no butt and anchor is wishy-washy. Spins wheels as drive blocker. Falls off of blocks when he becomes too dependent on leaning to create drive., PFA,," While he has decent size and good length, Croston lacks the necessary functional power to consistently handle the speed-to-power rushers he will see on the next level. If he is able to improve his core strength, he could have a future as a swing tackle, but that is a big ""if"". A zone-based offense might look at moving Croston inside to guard, but his lack of functional strength would still be a concern."
Des Lawrence,CB, Operates with patience from press. Allows receiver to commit before opening. Takes opportunities to play to his length. Looks to drape himself across inside shoulder against outside release. Does a decent job of staying in phase with routes outside the numbers. Has timing and arm length to work his hand into passing lane to disrupt the grab. Made a play on the ball on 22.8 percent of his targets over last two seasons. Adequate pattern recognition., Short stepper with sluggish hips that fail to flip smoothly. Plays too tall in coverage. Missing reactive athleticism to maintain coverage against receivers with quick feet. Slow to close out receivers who shake him off their release. Below average burst to the ball. Forced into playing the receiver rather than the quarterback at times. Had just three career interceptions. Thin frame takes a pounding in run support. Inconsistent wrap-up technique when coming downhill to challenge., PFA,," Tall, thin corner who has shown an ability to disrupt at the catch point when his coverage is right. He lacks the quickness to handle press-man on a consistent basis in the pros and his below average long speed will get him picked on quite a bit if isolated against a speedy target. Lawrence will get a shot in an NFL camp, but making a team will be a challenge."
Eric Wilson,LB, Posted impressive tackle numbers and has shown a nose for the ball. Has seven recovered fumbles for his career. Plays square to the line with a balanced base when scraping. Patient when flowing with running backs and is careful not to give away cutback opportunities. Can play off blocks into a tackle ready position. Has the agility and foot quickness to handle coverage responsibilities. Played in almost 50 percent of his team's special teams snaps over the last three seasons. Slippery in the open field in special teams coverage and has logged 25 special teams tackles in three years. Ran fast and jumped well at his pro day., Undersized inside linebacker. Stocky with short arms. Can find himself tethered to a block and taken for a long ride when he lets blockers into his frame. Very average at taking on blocks in the hole. Can be jostled out of his run fit by size. Allows too many climbing blockers to get a hand on him. Lacks force as a tackler and will allow additional yards after contact on some one-on-one battles. Will coast at times on the field. Appears to lack urgency in his coverage drops., Rounds 5-6,," Consistently productive safety-turned-linebacker who has played at inside linebacker but may be given a look as an outside linebacker due to his lack of size. Smith won't always play to his timed speed and he will allow completed passes that he should have a chance to defend. However, don't sleep on his tackle production as a special teamer as that could be his meal-ticket to making a team."
Jimmie Gilbert,OLB," Athletic, long-levered rusher who understands how to administer his length. Often able to land first punch and keep himself clean against tackles when setting edge. Can range as tackler. Fluid when asked to drop into space. Fires into pass rush with rare stride length to challenge the edge. Uses effective arm over on inside moves. Has foot quickness to shoot gaps. Human slinky with exceptional flexibility in hips and upper body to flip around the edge of blockers. Big closing burst to quarterback. Keeps feet moving through a tackle's initial punch. Strip-sack specialist looks to attack throwing arm when possible. Forced six fumbles this year alone. Athletic bloodlines with family full of college basketball players.", Thin waist with lanky frame that is all arms and legs. Poor play strength. Managed just 12 bench press reps at his pro day. Easily washed down in run game. It is imperative he keeps himself clean against tackles. A tackle with strong hands can own Gilbert if he gets into his frame. Lacks desired hand strength to clear a tackle's punch and soften the edge as a rusher. Will not convert speed to power often. Has had surgery on shoulder in the past. Needs more consistent pursuit motor from back-side. Not a physical tackler and will give up his fair share of broken and missed tackles as a pro., Round 7-PFA, Obum Gwacham," Gilbert is an intriguing prospect with outstanding length and athletic traits, but a lack of functional strength that could force teams to consider him as a situational rusher only. Gilbert is unlikely to have much of an impact against the run, but his long arms and upfield charge should have teams paying attention to him as a late round pass-rushing lottery ticket."
Justin Thomas,CB," Highly-respected, three-year captain as a quarterback. Tough and competitive. Handled the pressure that came with running Georgia Tech's option offense for three seasons. Recruited by Alabama as a defensive back and was a late replacement at the Senior Bowl at that same position. Ran a blazing 40-yard dash time at his pro day. Played baseball in high school and showed ability to track the ball in punt catching drills. Has reactive quickness to be targeted as a receiver.", Has no college experience at any other position. Will need extended time to learn a new position. Too small to play outside as a cornerback and will have to play as a slot corner. Has straight-line speed but just average short area footwork for the position. Lack of arm length and developed instincts could create a long wait for ball production in coverage. Scouts say he didn't look as natural in his receiver or cornerback movements as they had hoped., Priority free agent,," Developmental prospect who will have to learn a new position in the pros. Lacking in size but has the long speed and competitive nature that could afford him a quality chance to make a roster after a year or two on the practice squad. While the move to a new position will be challenging, Thomas could bolster his chances if he can develop into a quality kick or punt returner."
Patrick Gamble,DT, Plus physical traits to play 5-technique with exceptionally long arms and big hands. Plays with adequate punch and shed ability at point of attack. Gets arm extension and slides down the line of scrimmage mirroring runner when able. Decent athlete. Shows ability to disengage and range down the line using his length to make a tackle. Has good pursuit speed and motor. Former defensive end who has begun to grasp technique needed to play inside. Able to get skinny into the gaps against zone plays. Plays on kick block unit. Blocked a kick against Florida State in 2015 that was recovered and returned for game-winning touchdown., Former basketball player who still carries that build. Will need more time in the weight room to add bulk to his frame -- especially in the lower half. Plays with a narrow base and inconsistent pad level diminishing contact balance. Can be overwhelmed by double teams and driven off of his spot. Need to get better at controlling blocker at the point of attack to man his gap. Pass rush gets plugged up when blockers get clean punch into his frame. Struggles to clear the punch and disengage as a pass rusher. Pass rush lacks a plan and workable counter moves., Round 7-PFA,," Gamble is a trait-based project who is coming off of a productive senior season but who has moderate production beyond that. While he needs to add more bulk, he has the length and athleticism that 3-4 teams will want to work with at the defensive end spot. While he's a late-rounder or priority free agent, he could find himself on a practice squad while teams continue to groom him and see how much additional growth they can coax out of him as a player."
Quincy Mauger,S," Plays behind his pads and is willing to come up and land blows with force. Used as interchangeable safety and has experience covering move tight ends. Flashes decent ball skills when he's able to squeeze routes in man coverage. Even when he's stuck on receiver's hip, he finds ways to get a hand in passing lane. Fairly disciplined in his approach. Penalized just two times during his career. Has the hands to finish when interception opportunities arise. Had three defensive coordinators during his stay and his play could benefit from a static coaching situation. Flashed special teams talent as a freshman with 11 tackles.", Average size and athleticism with below average length. Lost substantial playing time under new defensive coordinator Mel Tucker with his defensive snap count dropping from 90 percent to 40 percent from last year to this year. Below average reactive athleticism as open field tackler. Play speed is slightly below average. Lacks hip fluidity and instincts to range cover as much of the field as teams might like. Slow to close from the hash to the sideline as a help safety. Not much of a pattern reader and doesn't have enough burst to play the ball. Needs improved field awareness., PFA,," Mauger (pronounced Mo-ZHAY) is an average athlete with average size and average speed and his play is average. While he plays with some physicality, there is nothing to really hang his hat on as a ""strength"" that evaluators might be able to cling to. He has an outside shot of being drafted and his path to playing time will likely rest on his ability to make plays on special teams as a backup safety."
Samson Kafovalu,DT, Put together an impressive pro day workout that should garner attention including 33 bench reps and a 32-inch vertical leap. Has experience in both odd and even fronts. Possesses punch and press power for two-gapping at the point of attack. Uses his strength to neutralize base block attempts. Plays with impressive quickness in his backside pursuit and can close down cutback lanes quickly when he's flowing. Has reactive quickness to make plays on running backs trying to sneak through his gap.," Is undersized as a defensive tackle. Is unusually slow off the snap and almost always the last out of his stance. Late start allows blockers to reach and seal him on both play-side and back-side blocks. Doesn't come off the snap with a quick, disruptive burst. Doesn't maintain square shoulders and gets pushed off his spot by down blocks. Feet are heavy and relatively inactive after first contact as a rusher. Doesn't work to an edge in his pass rush and won't be a third-down factor. Has had some off-field brushes with the law in 2012, 2013 and 2016.", PFA,," Impressive testing will have teams taking a second look, but finding a clearly defined role for Kafovalu could be a challenge. He flashes the athleticism to become a disruptive player, but his slow start out of his stance is an impediment as is his lack of consistent pass rush. He could be a late Day 3 target for a 4-3 team looking for athletic traits to mold."
Yamen Sanders,S," Impressive size. Carries a well-muscled, carved physique. Showed off eye-catching explosion numbers at his pro day. Has enough athletic ability and matchup footwork to line up against tight ends in coverage. Wrap-up tackler who sees what he hits. Has size and toughness that is built for box safety duties. Experienced in kick coverage."," Very labored when forced to flip his hips and run. Lacks range to play over the top in single-high or even Cover 2 looks. Bow-legged and plays on flat, heavy feet in his transitions on the throw. Movement in space feels clunky. Has to keep the play in front of him due to below average agility. Can be slow to react in play-action. Coverage filled with too many false steps and wasted motion.", UDFA,," His impressive size and leaping ability will force general managers to go put the tape on for this Arizona transfer, but ultimately, the tape doesn't show any facets where he truly excels. His traits will get him into a camp, but he'll face a challenge in making a roster early on."
Aaron  Cooper,OLB," Destroys the eyeball test compared to his teammates on a lower level. Has a long, athletic frame with well-proportioned build. Posted dominant tackle production as a starter. Will bring some thump into a running back's life. Quick-twitch linebacker who fires with force from coiled hips into the target. Has short area burst when he triggers to the ball. Flashes some ability to punch and extend to keep himself clean. Showed expanded tackle range when his motor was on.", Play urgency directly proportional to how close the ball is to him. Has a tendency to load around the field in pursuit. Relies on athleticism and physical traits over technique. Slow to diagnose and flow to the ball. Needs to attack wide receiver screens with more in pursuit. Level of competition offered him limited physical challenges. Not as fluid as expected in coverage., PFA,," Cooper leaps off the tape due to his athletic frame, but he would look like just another linebacker if paired with most FBS teams. His tackle production was dominant against that level of competition, but he needs to play with better anticipation and urgency to find a home in the NFL."
Ahmad Thomas,S, Three-year starter and team captain. Has background of overcoming adversity. Has experience lining up around the field. Does an adequate job of diagnosing the run and taking smart angles to the football. May have enough size and quickness to line up over tight ends in coverage. Core special teams player in all four years at Oklahoma. Had a better 2015 and teams will likely use some of that tape to create his draft grade.," Lacks speed. Doesn't make enough plays. Never forced a fumble during his time at Oklahoma. More of a grab-and-drag tackler than enforcer. Below average athlete and can be stiff in space as a tackler. Has excessive number of missed tackles over the last two seasons. Ball production is disappointing for a three-year starter. Has just 11 career passes defensed including four interceptions. Reads quarterbacks, but is slow to trigger to the throw.", PFA,," Thomas has the experience and success as a special teams player that will give him an advantage when trying to secure a roster spot, but he can't hang his hat on being a box safety or a cover specialist and his lack of deep speed is a concern. Thomas could find himself on the undrafted free agent list with a need to excel on special teams in limited camp reps to have a shot at making a roster."
Brandon Barnes,TE," Has high end physical makeup. Has extremely long limbs with the body type to carry beyond the 255 pounds he comfortably carries now. Has good speed for his size and is an above average leaper. Can get up and snatch the high point challenges in the red zone. Plays with plus body control. Able to find throws quickly and adjust to throws outside his frame when working the seam. Able to catch through contact. Has frame to become a positional, wall-off blocker at point of attack with more weight-room work. Long strider can amass separation on crossers and vertical work. Has worked as H-back and in-line tight end."," Duck-footed runner who can be a little slow to release and get into his routes from off the snap. Plays slower than his timed speed. Will need to intensify his pace when running routes. Very little instincts as a run blocker when adjustments are needed. Run blocking technique may be a ""from scratch"" assignment for position coaches. Route work was basic and scheme created several wide open looks down the seam and through backside boot-action where he dragged underneath from H-back spot. Posted marginal production as pass-catcher.", Rounds 7-PFA,," While there is tape to watch for Barnes, it doesn't take very long to get through most of his targets since his pass-catching production was limited, comparatively speaking. Barnes has the frame, length and athletic ability that teams love to groom. He's very raw and will require patience and extensive work as a blocker and receiver, but there is enough of a ceiling to make him a Day 3 or priority free agent pickup."
Brandon Wilson,RB," Was the talk of the pro day running 4.36 with a vertical jump of 41 inches, broad jump of 11-feet-1 and 24 bench reps. Versatility could be a selling point. Could be targeted as cornerback, safety or running back. Limited reps as a runner, but looked good. Uses functional jump cut to avoid trouble. Tough runner who can power through angle tackles. Runs with good knee bend and stays behind his pads. Willing to sink and deliver a blow at the finish. Has controlled stride and foot quickness to string together cuts. Offers value as kick returner and in kick coverage. His 100-yard ""kick-six"" return for a touchdown created huge momentum shift in Houston's week one upset win over Oklahoma."," Hip tightness limited his ability to make plays on the ball as a cornerback and create average elusiveness in tight quarters as a running back. Will have to find a set position in the pros. As a running back, needs to improve his vision and decisiveness between the tackles. Needs to run with better patience and control. Balance was a little inconsistent in space. Used primarily on swing passes. Will need to expand route-running and prove he can protect to garner third down reps.", Rounds 4-5, Orleans Darkwa," Explosive athlete who could be considered on either side of the ball as a defensive back or a running back. Wilson doesn't have as many flashes on tape at cornerback as he does at running back, but his he was primarily a fill-in at running back in a few games over the last two years due to injury. If Wilson transitions to running back, he will be a developmental prospect who could make a roster sooner over later thanks to his kick return potential."
David Jones,FS, Intelligent player. Late-bloomer who has added relatively sudden mass to his frame and might be able to carry more. Made play after play on the ball his junior season. Has quality ball tracking skills. Able to make early adjustments to put himself in position to make the interception. Possesses soft hands and plus body control and does a good job of challenging at the high-point. Long strides can eat up turf when make-up speed is needed. Has combination of range and instincts to handle single-high safety duties. Allows quarterback's eyes to help him shade his coverage. Does his part in run support when it's time to step in and strike. More wrap-up tackler than shoulder striker., Durability is a serious concern for scouts. Has had multiple injuries to the same left forearm that has caused him to miss time. Angular frame needs more muscle to improve play strength. Needs to improve at taking on or slipping blocks. Will hit and slide off of tackles at times. Comes downhill at inconsistent angles and can run himself out of position. Long strider in controlled spaces. More fast than quick and can be a little slow to flip hips and accelerate. Too much gliding in space rather than hitting the jets in pursuit or in coverage. Play-action can draw him out of position., Round 6-7,," An impressive pro day put Jones back on the radars of NFL evaluators after missing a good portion of this year with a forearm injury. Jones plays with decent instincts and plus ball skills but he needs to improve his overall aggressiveness and physicality as a run supporter. Concerns over his durability could hurt his draft stock, but his size, speed and ball production are worthy of NFL consideration."
Keith Towbridge,TE, Has a big frame to work with. Rare in-line size coming out of the college game. Flashes some favorable impact at the point of attack as a blocker from time to time. Has some fluidity in his lateral movement and when asked to get into space as a blocker. Tape shows a player that may have enough speed to get over top of linebackers and attack the seam. Uses big body to swallow throws in the middle of the field and protect the catch in traffic. Can be a heavy payload to tackle when he is rumbling down the field after the catch., Low-end production as a pass catcher with just 21 career receptions. Hands are below average. Below average adjustment to throws outside his frame. Infrequently the primary in-line blocking option from base packages. Limited short area quickness makes him a static target underneath. Bulldozer getting into his routes. Needs to get better at adjusting to contact off of his release. Sloppy hand placement as a blocker causing a lack of block sustain. Tends to lean and needs better knee bend at point of attack., PFA,," Teams will be intrigued by Towbridge's size, but his inconsistency as a blocker could hurt his chances to be drafted late as a blocking tight end. He'll need work with his blocking technique, but his frame could buy him a year or two on a practice squad while teams try to turn him into a functional blocker who can make a roster."
Kenny Allen,P," Handled kicking, kickoff and punting duties for Michigan this season. Big frame for a kicker and is a willing tackler who can stop a return from turning into six. Was sixth in the nation in average kickoff distance at 64.2. Showed marked improvement in touchback rate from junior to senior season. Has a big leg as a punter and can flip the field. Landed 46 percent of his punts inside the 20-yard line.", Not as consistent as teams would like from beyond 40 yards. His operational time can get too quick which affects accuracy. Missed three consecutive field goals against Wisconsin this season. Has just one field goal beyond 50 yards. Has just one season as a full-time punter., PFA,," Teams will have to decide on how to use Allen, but punting may be his ultimate calling with kickoff duties as a possibility. Allen balances a big leg along with an ability to handle positional punting once it is time to back the opponent up against their endzone."
Matt Davis,K," Handled kicking, kick-off and punting duties at Pembroke. Made 84.1 percent of his field goals as a senior and holds twelve school records. Nicknamed ""Legatron 2.0"" by one special teams coach. Hit six of seven 50-plus field goals in 2016 including a 58-yarder. Generates good trajectory on long field goals. Kicked a 32-yard field goal at age 7.", Will have to prove he can kick on a substantially larger stage. Kickoff distance was a little inconsistent at times. May have to speed up approach to football from 2.5 steps to two., Round 7-PFA,, Kickers with big legs always have a shot at getting drafted -- especially when they can handle kickoff duties consistently. Davis has the leg to handle those duties and his background as a punter will add to his draft value. He could hear his name called on the third day.
Matt Haack,P, Finished sixth in the nation with a net punting average of 42 yards. Very good ratio of punt distance to hang-time (4.21 hang time in 2016). Forced a fair catch rate of 36.4 percent and was able to keep his coverage team in good position to make plays allowing just 65 total return yards this year. Snap-to-punt time has been consistent in all three years as the starting punter. Able to avoid touchbacks. Has a booming leg that has pasted punts of 70-plus yards in each of the last two seasons., Has had three punts returned for touchdowns in his career. Scouts say he needs to improve consistency of distance as well as his directional punting., Round 7-PFA,, Left-footed punter with a field-flipping leg that can dig his team out of holes. Haack is a three-year punter who does a nice job of balancing a desire to boom the big kick with hanging the ball up for fair catches. His quality operational time and hang-time give him a chance at hearing his name called on the third day.
Xavier Coleman,CB," Intelligent, focused and and resilient. Missed two and a half years of high school football due to a heart condition. Won two state basketball titles as a starting point guard and finished first team all-state in track before making his way back on the field after open-heart surgery cleared the way for his return. Concedes nothing when the ball is in the air. Tracks the ball well and finds optimal position to crowd receiver and prepare to play the ball. Explosive 40-inch vertical jumper. Shows good route anticipation and looks to play in front of the route breaks. Excellent communication with teammates calling out route development from zone coverage. Plays with urgency in his man coverage and looks to close-out any route separation as quickly as possible."," Fluidity of feet in man coverage is just average. Can be knocked off the route by clever route runners with quickness. Hips are a little sticky in his transitions from press and will pop upright before triggering. Is a little delayed in opening to chase an inside release. Shows some panic when routes cross his face and will grab receivers around the waist to corral them rather than relying on technique and feet. Will occasionally lose contain in run support. Too slow to punch and shed against blocking receivers. Tackling fundamentals are below average. Too many arm tackles and not enough face up, wrap-up strikes.", PFA,," Coleman plays with great urgency in his coverage and has a history of ball production when he's challenged. Coleman has adequate height and speed for the perimeter but could struggle to maintain man coverage against NFL quickness and speed. He has the awareness and ball skills to play zone, but will need a much more consistent approach as a tackler."
Alex Scearce,LB," Football intelligence is above average. Moved from safety to linebacker and showed rapid growth at the position from 2015 to 2016. Fluid athlete with loose movement skills and good closing burst to catch corner-turning running backs. Showed off ability to make winning defensive plays with five interceptions, eight sacks and three forced fumbles this season. Has very good hands and showed marked improvement with his ball skills. Called extremely competitive in everything he does by teammates. Has background and athleticism to compete in man coverage. Has special teams value."," Still needs to operate with better pre-snap anticipation. Lack of experience at linebacker causes a delay in diagnosis at times. Slow starts allow climbing linebackers to seal him along the backside. Will have to play with better pace to have a shot. Hand fighting and play strength are both below average. Needs to play with faster, more violent hands to keep himself clean. Struggles to play through contact and maintain his run fit. Would benefit from a more downhill attack.", Round 7-PFA,," Scearce is a 4-3 weakside linebacker who will need to improve his instincts and play strength to make the transition into the league. His athleticism and cover potential could work in his favor, but at this point he looks like he will be fighting for a back end of the roster spot and will need to shine on special teams to get a shot beyond the practice squad early on."
Austin Ekeler,RB," Plays bigger than he measures. Low center of gravity provides above average power through contact. Can give as well as he gets and usually falls forward. Creates with power and elusiveness. Dancing feet and swivel hips allow for sudden, sharp cuts on the second level. Shows ability to string moves together. Able to factor as a pass catcher and looks comfortable doing it. Three-time academic all-American who exhibits his smarts on the field as well as off it. Posted explosion numbers at his pro day that will have teams looking for more tape.", Smaller than teams will look for from the position. Doesn't always find the cleanest portions of running lanes. Will look to crouch and finish when there are still moves to be made between the tackles. Will have to prove himself as a blocker to find third down snaps. Limited route-runner out of the backfield in college., Round 7-PFA,," He's a little smaller than teams might like, but he's well-built and a competitive runner with power as a finisher. Ekeler played a much lower level of competition so it is challenging to project whether his ability to create yardage through elusiveness and power will translate. Ekeler's tape appears to show the necessary athletic traits and rushing talent to compete for a roster spot and become an NFL contributor at some point."
Cody Heiman,FB, Linebacker with the play demeanor to move to fullback. Played running back for one season in college giving him a sneak peak at the offensive line of scrimmage. Possesses good power (31 bench reps at his pro day) and above average low body explosiveness for a fullback. Plays with some edge when it is time to mix it up at the point of attack. Lays a heavy shoulder into blockers which could translate to fullback position. Play strength is adequate as is his balance through contact., Will take time to learn a new position. Lateral agility is below average. Requires extended gear down to redirect his weight. Could struggle to find moving targets as a lead blocking fullback. Will need to prove he has hands to be deployed in play-action. Small town kid could take awhile to acclimate to life in the NFL., PFA,," His college tape as a linebacker isn't NFL caliber, but he does have the physical play demeanor and the strength needed to potentially make a move to fullback. It will take Heiman time to learn a new position and the practice squad might be the best he can hope for early in his career. He may have to turn into a special teams machine to get much of a look beyond his rookie camp."
Dalton Crossan,RB," Powerfully built with thick trunk and good body composition. Has enough explosiveness in his hips to crash through arm tacklers and plow forward. Recruited at a high level for lacrosse, but chose football due to his love for the game. Two years of quality production as both a runner and pass catcher. Has experience running routes from the slot. Adequate run-after-catch ability. Natural pass-catcher possessing supple hands to pluck-and-tuck quickly. Provides four years of kick return experience.", Has some hip tightness that limits his effectiveness in making sharp cuts both as a ball carrier and route runner. Unable to stick-and-go as one-cut runner needing more runway to gear down before cutting. Vision as a runner is average. A little sluggish in lateral escape quickness when tacklers close in. Needs more knee bend as a runner. Short arms show up on tape when asked to reach outside his frame to bring in a poorly thrown ball. Does not appear to be a dynamic separator out of his breaks., PFA,," Crossan could be challenging to place in terms of finding a position fit. He may lack the elusiveness, burst and vision to be counted on for NFL carries and he doesn't appear to have the desired separation quickness as a receiver. His versatility will help his cause, but he may not be as smooth a projection from running back to wide receiver as teams might hope despite his excellent hands."
Dylan Cole,LB," Built like a pro wrestler with muscles on top of muscles. Looks physical and plays physical. Forceful player who attacks blocks and tackles opportunities with the same aggression. Not a consistently static target on second level and is able to slip blocks when needed. Freak show pro day results including 32 bench reps, 39-inch vertical leap and a strong 40-yard dash. Instinctive and aware. Reads keys and flows to ball ahead of blockers. Scrapes with good quickness and squared pads. When attacking downhill, careful not to commit to a gap too early and get caught in the trash. Flashes some quick-start burst to chase runners to the sideline and crossing routes that appear in his area.", Straight-line player with tightly bundled hips. Will struggle to redirect his weight quickly in space. Extremely pigeon-toed. Rarely low man when attacking running backs. Needs to play with better bend to become a leverage tackler rather than a running back catcher in the hole. Lateral agility is below desired level for an inside linebacker. Average recovery athleticism when he gets behind. May need to come off the field on passing downs., Round 5,," Cole's pro day workout will force teams to scramble back to the tape to see if the play matches up to the explosive numbers. He has some flexibility issues because of how tightly bound his frame is, but he flashes explosive get-off off the snap and he's got above average vision and anticipation that helps him take accurate paths to the football. Cole could be a third day pick and early special teams contributor who can play either inside or outside in a 4-3."
Jonathan Dorsey,TE," Hasty and smooth in his release off the line of scrimmage and into his route. Athletic, long-strider can climb on top of and past safeties before they have a chance to respond. Will be challenging for linebackers to run with him down the field in man coverage. Has the juice to create easy separation on intermediate routes and crossing routes. Showed off plus speed along with explosive broad jump at his pro day. Long arms provide a plus catch radius. Has body control to make challenging adjustments to the ball. Put some impressive combat catches together on tape. Above average run-after-catch ability. Has some experience playing in-line."," Lack of consistency with hands is frustrating. Not a natural hands-catcher and corrals rather than plucks. Allows too many throws to beat him up. Can make contested catches but will drop easier throws. Routes need more purpose. Lacks a dangerous jab step or head fake at the top or his routes to sway defenders. Doesn't always sink into open spaces against zone coverage. Needs to do a better job of improvising to uncover for scrambling quarterbacks. Will have to hit the weights and improve his play strength. Not ready to handle NFL blocking responsibility and may be forced into full-time ""matchup"" role.", Rounds 7-PFA,," Dorsey has good size, length and speed and those traits alone give him a chance to hear his name called on Day 3. He's much more effective at getting open when releasing from off the line of scrimmage and his ability to separate is hard to ignore. His lack of NFL blocking and ball skills will put him on the ""do not draft"" list for some teams, but his athleticism and ceiling make him a lottery ticket worth scratching."
Jordan Evans,LB, Carries prototypical NFL frame for the position with low body fat and good length. Flexible and athletic. Productive tackler. Able to turn the corner sharply and track down running backs looking to burst between the tackles. Plus reactive quickness for sudden lateral explosion as a tackler. Has the twitch-trigger to fire downhilll and make plays. Carries outstanding play speed and has the potential to range around the field if kept clean. Fluid cover man in space in man or zone. Possesses ball skills and physical tools to play all three downs. Had twelve passes defensed this season including four interceptions.," Finesse player. Scouts say he turns down too many opportunities to bang when it is in front of him. Often at the mercy of blockers. Needs to play stronger to maintain control of the rep in run support. Struggles to leverage his gap. Inconsistent angles to the football takes him out of some plays. Needs to be a more squared, physical finisher as a tackler. Allowed too many missed and broken tackles this season.", Rounds 5-6,," Productive, three-year starter who will garner attention as a height, weight, speed prospect especially after his strong pro day workout. Evans may lack the physical nature to hold up inside so he may have to find his way as a backup outside linebacker. Evans has enough traits and talent to become an eventual starter if he can play with better toughness and consistency."
Kevin Snead,WR, Possesses legitimate world-class speed that could make him the fastest man in the league the day he sets foot in an NFL camp. The vertical threat that will force safeties into shading to his side early. Could get looks as both wide receiver and cornerback by teams. Explosive leaper. Has a kick return touchdown to his name., Track athlete who has suited out for a football team. Has barely played football. Has just five college catches and very little tape. Lost awareness of the sideline on two of his catches. Scouts say they didn't see enough receiver reps in his workout due to stiffness in a leg that developed during workout., UDFA,," Snead's ability to run exceptionally fast in a straight line is unquestioned, but his ability to pick up a position and become a legitimate talent who can play on the next level is. While rare traits will often get drafted, it is unlikely that anyone will pull the trigger on a guy with so few reps no matter how fast he is. He will find his way into a camp and have a chance to prove whether he deserves an extended look in the sport."
Tueni Lupeamanu,DT," Quick-twitch athlete with an ability to get out of his stance and populate the neutral zone quickly. Possesses quality spin move that has some potential if coached up. Feet are nimble and quick and allow him to Euro-step from one shoulder to the opposite shoulder against pass protection. Has lateral agility and quickness to make it difficult to cross his face for guards and tackles. Uses fast hands, spin moves and clever arm-overs to help disengage from blocks. Plays with above average change of direction and pursuit speed to chase scrambling quarterbacks. Has athletic traits to become more disruptive in an aggressive, one-gap scheme.", Doesn't possess a natural frame for interior work and lacks length of an edge player. Missing overall girth to anchor against power and could have an issue keeping enough weight up. Unable to grind through a blocker's edge with pure power and rarely imposes his well. Uses below average pass rush skills. Needs to create a go-to rush move and counter in order to create value as sub-package rusher. Doesn't pair his hands with his nimble feet for optimal usage of athleticism., Round 7-PFA,," Lupeamanu is an intriguing athlete whose athleticism and ability to play with good pursuit quickness could appeal to teams looking for a disruptive three-technique that they can continue to mold. However, he lacks the bulk teams will be looking for and unless he proves he can put weight on and keep it on, his size could become a non-starter for teams."
Anthony Wales,RB," Glider who is faster than he looks when he gets his legs stretched. Feet are so light they barely seem to touch the ground. Can make sudden, sharp jump cuts and string moves together to create miss after miss. Has one-cut ability and will run with decisiveness. Runs with ample burst to the perimeter and should be able to force defenses to respect his ability to get the edge. Understands protections and makes necessary adjustments against twists and blitzes. Reliable pass catcher with seven of his 30 grabs going for 20-plus yards.", Undersized frame with a narrow base. Will not create for himself with power. Runs with very little pop after contact and could have trouble as an interior runner on the next level. Would benefit from bigger burst through the line of scrimmage and onto the second level. Gets ahead of himself and gives away his rush lane choice rather than setting up his blocks and waiting for body on body contact in front of him. Benefitted from WKU scheme that allowed him to run against light boxes inside., Round 7-PFA,," He lacks the frame and strength to handle much of an NFL workload, but he does have some ""change of pace"" qualities as a runner. Wales can create through elusiveness, but has never shown himself to be a consistent run-after-contact back. His experience at handling protections and catching the football make him a candidate for a job as a third-down back."
B.J. Bello,OLB," Smooth athlete with some noteworthy traits in his ledger. Possesses quick feet paired with an explosive burst. Has the ability to pursue to the perimeter with excellent speed to help close the door against runners looking to turn corner. Has experience and athleticism to handle man coverage responsibilities. Flashed interesting pass rush potential with sink and corner calling card around the edge. Long arms combined with speed and explosion testing will give him an advantage over maxed out, average athletes."," One year of productive football. Unable to break into starting lineup at Illinois for three years before transferring for 2016 season. Poor play strength. Struggles mightily to unglue and make plays once aggressive blockers get their hands on him. Too passive at the point of attack and lacks desired ""dog"" demeanor on the field. Below average feel and instincts when playing the run. Too few determined shots into the gaps to disrupt and make a play.", PFA,," Bello's measurables and pro day results will get him a look in camp, but it may be as a priority free agent. He needs to be stronger and tougher to hold up as a 4-3 linebacker which is where he'll likely project. Teams could look to bulk him up and see if he could become a situational rusher off the edge, but he'll have to become a quality special teams player to make that a possibility."
Tim Patrick,WR," Offers up a quality ratio of size, speed and quickness. Long-strider who can eat into cushion on vertical routes. Plays with consistent level of confidence. Showed off his competitive nature and held his own against four cornerbacks who should go in the first two days in Kevin King, Sidney Jones (Washington), Adoree Jackson (USC) and Chidobe Awuzie (Colorado). Better-than-expected play strength and quality hand fighting help him clear press coverage. Works to stack corners when he gets on top of them. Impressive catch radius extends in all directions outside of his frame. Able to finish catches with corners draped on top of him. Brings some attitude to the field as a blocker and can be effective in that capacity."," He's been a factory of injuries over his three seasons at Utah, missing 17 games. Saw limited route tree and was primarily a vertical threat with slants mixed in. Routes lack smoothness. Will need working setting up his breaks and stems. Tape speed doesn't always match his timed speed (4.47). Needs runway to build-up his speed. Struggled to find necessary vertical separation to open throwing windows against talented trail coverage from Kevin King and Sidney Jones. Shows inconsistent focus when working over the middle leading to some drops. Defaults to body catching.", Round 6-7,," Patrick is a size-speed prospect with vertical ability and above average play strength who plays with a competitive spirit. Utah asked him to get deep and make contested catches underneath so he will have to prove that can operate on the intermediate level. Durability concerns could cause him to fall out of the draft. Patrick's size, tape and workout give him a shot to make the back end of an NFL roster in the future."
Brandon Bell,OLB," Per game production was impressive this season. Has forced six fumbles over the last two seasons and has an interception in each of the last three seasons, including two this year. Student of the game. Plays with instincts and good awareness on the field. Able to sniff out misdirection and screen plays quickly. Has a feel for slipping blockers and finding the action when playing downhill. Disciplined in zone coverage. Considered one of the team leaders.", Slightly undersized. Has missed six games over the last two seasons due to injury. Gets in trouble when he sits back on second level rather than attacking the line of scrimmage. Can get muscled around by second level blockers. Below average foot quickness and agility could limit effectiveness against shifty runners. Doesn't have the sudden burst to close out running backs headed for the edge. Needs the action to stay near the box., Round 7-PFA,," Bell is a physical tackler who plays the game with good instincts and fundamentals, but he has some athletic limitations that could hurt his chances on the next level. He flashed decent straight-line speed which gives him a chance to carve out a spot for himself in kick coverage for a team who believes he's good enough to handle backup linebacker duties."
Cole Luke,CB," Good teammate with solid football intelligence and character. Fluid athlete with easy hips and clean pedal. Has short area reactive quickness to continue to mirror routes when footwork is right. Durable, three-year starter who has developed above average pattern recognition. Cover skills and ball skills are decent. Able to turn and find the ball when back is to the quarterback. Finished college career with eight interceptions.", Average size for the position with short arms and small hands. Slightly below average ball production over the last two seasons. Long speed is a concern in league circles. Unable to carry speed down the field and stick to burners. Excessive amount of touchdowns allowed came when he was unable to make a play on 50-50 caliber balls. Posted disappointing bench press numbers. Needs to improve tackling technique., Round 7-PFA,," Came into the season with some moderate buzz, but failed to put together a memorable season as a man-cover corner. Luke's football intelligence and ability to mirror and match underneath are worthy of a look, but there aren't enough check marks in the physical or play trait columns. Luke has an outside shot of getting drafted, but could be a priority free agent who faces a challenge to find a roster spot."
Ryan Lewis,CB, Comfortable from press coverage. Uses pesky jab to disrupt receivers releasing into their routes. Presents himself as an annoyance in mirror-and-match coverage underneath. Better as a blanket than playing off. Stays low in his retreat and opens with smooth hips. Possesses twitch in his feet that showed up at his pro day and on tape when triggering on throws in front of him. Plays with toughness in his run support. Attacks blockers and rarely waits on ball carriers to bring it to him. Effective special teams cover talent. Posted A-plus test numbers at his pro day including two sub-4.40 40-yard dash times., Just one year of starting experience. Inexperience showed up with six pass interference penalties this season. Would panic and attack receiver rather than finding ball down the field. Make up speed on tape looks nowhere near his pro day 40 time. Consistently allowed deep ball separation to Oklahoma State wideouts. Displays some balance issues when redirecting from his shuffle and transitioning forward. Pattern recognition is still a work in progress., Round 7-PFA,," Lewis has decent size and his explosive leaping and blazing 40 time at his pro day is likely to get the attention of teams looking for athletic traits late in the draft or as a priority free agent. Lewis' lack of experience showed up on tape, but he does have short area quickness to work with and he's willing as a corner and on special teams. Lewis has work to do, but he's got a shot for a team willing to groom him."
Rashaad Coward,DT, Has desired NFL size for multiple spots along the defensive line. Shoots hands quickly into blocker's frame and usually creates early arm extension. Has flashes on tape where he can impress as read-and-react defender at point of attack. May have enough flexibility to play as a big nose in a 3-4. Looks to attack under the pads and roll his hips under his extended arms to generate a leverage point. Has ability to set a strong edge. Consistent tackler when runner is in his domain. Decent short area athlete. His arm over move can create early wins for him.," High cut with below average leg thickness and thin calves. Relatively untested by NFL-caliber competition on the offensive line. Needs to become a more skilled hand fighter for faster disengagements. Gets caught up in one-on-one battles with the man in front of him rather than playing through the blocker and playing towards the play. Gets shoulders turned too easily on angle blocks. Ankle stiffness limits lateral agility and quickness for twists. Gets some initial push as a pass rusher, but has very limited pass rush production.", Round 7-PFA,," Coward is a little bit high-cut which could be a concern for his ability to anchor, but his size and ability to create some separation as a 2-gapper at the point of attack makes him worthy of late round consideration for a 3-4 team who might view him as an inside or outside lineman. He's limited as a pass rusher so his ceiling might be early down backup."
Max Rich,OT, Possesses long arms at the end of a solid frame that should be able to add lean muscle mass with full-time attention to weight work and less attention to economics studies. Plays with adequate balance and body control. Keeps head out of pass protection punch. Plays with above average hand strength. Latches onto defenders in both pass pro and run game. Aggressive finisher with decent block sustaining. Plays with some edge. Lateral quickness is a plus. Gains a check mark for work in getting across the face of defensive tackles and getting to react blocks on defensive ends. Keeps working feet and hips after contact to improve position to seal his blocks., Level of competition did not challenge with level of power and quickness he will see on the next level. Will allow feet to gallop to the edge rather than sliding when he fears getting beat around the corner. Doesn't gain ground quickly enough in pass pro to project to left side. Can be a little too straight-legged in his pass sets. More of a catcher than a puncher. Opens himself up to speed-to-power rushers with his elevated pad level. Whipped smaller defensive ends with power but jump to NFL could be tough adjustment for a year., PFA,," Rich carries a good ratio of size to quickness and his arm length is on par with what teams expect from the tackle spot. He plays with an aggressive demeanor and is a willing and able finisher, but his lack of experience against quality opposition makes his transition to the NFL difficult to project. He appears to lack the knee bend and kick-slide to handle life on the left side so he will likely have to give it a go at right tackle. He could become a practice squad player early on who fights for a backup role down the line."
Khalid Abdullah,RB," Ran for 1,809 yards and 22 touchdowns on 298 carries. Patient runner who allows lead blockers to do their thing. Quick processor of what he sees. Sees his track and reacts decisively. Able to avoid early trouble with sharp jump-cuts. Makes first and second level cuts in rhythm. Has contact balance to absorb blows and fall forward. Has feel for interior running and runs tough between the tackles. Natural inside/outside zone runner. Has ability to change gears within the run to suit the situation. Able to lower a shoulder and take a blow. Able to be utilized out of the backfield in basic pass-catching role."," Falls just under the size parameters for what teams like in draftable, early down running backs. Elusiveness can be hit-or-miss. His 40 time is disappointing. Leaves some yardage on the field when he's unable to shake safeties in open field. Tape shows a little bit of inconsistency in his aggressiveness as a finisher. Will need additional work in pass protection before he's ready to handle NFL blitzers. Faces up rushers but doesn't anchor down well enough.", PFA,," Abdullah's monstrous production will catch your attention and his tape makes him worthy of NFL consideration. There is nothing special about his size or speed, but he has the vision, burst and courage to potentially factor in as an undrafted running back who can fit into an inside/outside zone rushing team. He isn't ready for consideration as a third down back so he needs to prove he can shine in kick coverage."
Derrick Jones,CB," Has explosive leaping ability. Posted monster numbers in vertical (41 inches) and broad jump (11 feet 8 inches) at pro day. Has played both cornerback and wide receiver. Uses length, ball skills and pattern recognition to his advantage. Displays some talent and ball production from trail position. Aggressive sprinter down the field in kick coverage makes him an early responder."," Stringy, gangly frame. Posted just nine reps on bench press and will need to add muscle to hold up in the league. Takes the worst of it as a grab and drag tackler. Doesn't play with the instant trigger on the throw that is expected. Below average footwork for short area change of direction. Could be limited in scheme fit.", PFA,," Jones' limited reps at cornerback may work in his favor as secondary coaches could see him as a moldable prospect they can try and develop from scratch. He's got the length and explosion traits that will appeal to teams looking for tall, press corners. However, his play strength must improve. Jones is unlikely to get drafted but could be an interesting project for a team looking to use him in a press-and-trail coverage."
Jhajuan Seales,WR," Solid combination of size and speed. Has decent play strength that shows up when working the middle of the field. Possesses strong hands with ability to make contested catches. His 41.5-inch vertical leap allows him to climb way up the ladder to snare passes, but he can sink and scoop the low ones as well. Has body control for in-air adjustments to the throw. Plays with good feet and concentration near the sideline. Created separation out of his stems on post routes. Ball tracking is a plus.", Routes will need work. Straight-liner who rarely gets much sink into route breaks for sharp cuts. Has a tendency to give away out-breaking routes with early leans. Will have to prove he can beat press as a pro. Showed some issues getting clean releases when corners were under his chin. Needs work as a blocker as he wasn't asked to do it much in their scheme., PFA,, Explosion numbers at his pro day were good and his 40 time (4.51) is considered solid for a receiver his size. Seales is a decent second and third level receiver who lacks the bend and wiggle underneath to uncover with clever routes. His strong hands and ability to catch the ball through contact combined with his pro day testing make him an intriguing prospect as a likely priority free agent.
Jamal Agnew,CB," Very good athlete who was a First Team all-conference point guard and a 100 meter champion as a sprinter. Ran two blazing sub 4.4 official times at his pro day. Displays decent pattern recognition. Explosive, quick-twitch corner with an ability to bounce and trigger on throws underneath. Has closing burst to close on throws and disrupt at the catch point. Is extremely physical when challenging the catch. Nabbed eleven career interceptions. Aggressive in run support and looks to power through blockers to meet runners near backfield. Plays with tough field demeanor. Has punt return talent and took one to the house this season.", Too small to play on the outside and lacks the weight that teams typically want from slot corners who are forced into tackling roles in today's game. Has short limbs and small hands. Gets impatient from press coverage and can be juked into an early commitment allowing receiver an easier release. Uses hands freely to push and pull at receivers and will have to trust his feet and technique to limit penalties as a pro. Can be inconsistent in mirroring routes from trail position., Rounds 6-7, Charles James," Four-year starter who is extremely confident and competitive out on the field and has the make-up speed to cover up for early mistakes. Agnew's lack of size and length makes him a slot-only corner and could force him into undrafted status, but his ball skills, speed and punt return potential give him a shot to make it down the road."
J.R. Nelson,CB, Good height and extraordinary arm length. Arms measure in at over 34.5 inches which is incredibly rare at the position. Showed off solid agility drill numbers at his pro day. Possesses quality footwork and some short-area quickness to bird-dog receivers in their routes. Will make a high percentage of plays on the ball when he's able to crowd the route. Plays with adequate change of direction to mirror in-breaking routes. Good ball-tracker when forced to into a vertical chase. Plays with hustle. Willing to attack run support responsibility with some aggressiveness.," Lives in a thin frame. Doesn't have finishing power as tackler and will allow ""drag yards"" after contact with runners. Played in just five games his senior season due to a suspension for a failed drug test administered by NCAA during 2015 playoffs. Ran in the high 4.5 range (official time) at his pro day. Tape shows a player who doesn't have instant burst into a makeup gear when beaten over the top. Weak in his upper body and declined to bench press at his pro day. Can be banged off-balance by physical receivers. Needs to commit to challenging the catch after triggering on the throw.", Round 7-PFA,," In the negative column, he's thin and lacks adequate play strength and long speed. However, his extreme arm length will be very enticing to teams looking to add weight to his frame and turn him into a press and trail cornerback. Nelson has a shot to become a ""make it guy"" but may need another year of work on building up his frame."
Casey DeAndrade,S," Four-year starter at cornerback. Ran impressive 4.46 40 at his pro day. Durable, tough and active. Production totals were impressive. Posted 62 career passes defensed including nine interceptions over four years. Plays with noticeable instincts and pattern anticipation. Footwork is adequate for initial stages of coverage at cornerback. Has experience playing outside and from the slot. Uses well-timed hip flips to maintain coverage against vertical routes. Willing to mix it up in run support. His 22 bench reps are way beyond the average for defensive backs. Can return kicks and punts.", Eyes linger on play-action fakes giving receivers an opening to get past him. Limbs are much shorter than desired. Could struggle to make plays on the ball against taller competition on the next level. Appears to have straight-line speed rather than short-area quickness. Acceleration is delayed from his transitions. Doesn't have desired makeup burst when beaten vertically or on crossing routes. Reactive athleticism and lateral quickness for open field tackling is below par. May be forced into a move to a new position at safety., UDFA,," Despite his impressive 40 time at his pro day, DeAndrade's football speed on tape looks fairly average. He's a little bit tight-hipped which shows up when he's asked to change direction suddenly. He's versatile and tough and might be able to transition to safety, but special teams play will be his big shot to make a team."
David Rivers,CB, Tall cornerback with good short-area quickness. Generally patient in his approach from press and will wait for receiver to commit to a path first. Has quickness to try and match routes underneath. Low body is on a smooth swivel to open hips and run with receivers. Understands angles and does quality job of maintaining outside leverage when coverage call for it. Attacks at the catch-point are well-timed., Needs to play with better knee bend for better directional change against comeback routes. Lacking ball production of a draftable cornerback. Has just three career interceptions and limited passes broken up. Long speed is slightly below average. Will need to play with much better aggressiveness in run support. Too often allows blocking receivers to control the action. Shies away as a tackler at times., PFA,," Rivers length is a plus and he's a pretty smooth athlete, but his lack of ball production and physicality could be a turn-off to some teams. Rivers will make it into a camp and could make some noise as a cover corner, but winning a roster spot will be challenging with a practice squad spot potentially being his best hope early on."
Woody Baron,DT," Plays with above average agility and movement skills. Moves quickly down the line of scrimmage in pursuit of the ball. Athletic enough to pursue from tackle to tackle. Despite his lack of size, does an adequate job of keeping blockers at the end of his punch to provide opportunities to diagnose plays. Has good arm over and dead arm moves to get to the blockers edge. Subtle, but efficient with his hand quickness to get him around the edge of a blocker once he gets there. Plays with good closing burst to quarterback.", Size falls well below NFL standards for his position. Built like a squatty defensive end. Gets walloped out of position by down blocks and double teams. Full-time starter just one season. Does not have the anchor for early-down work as an interior defender. Workout numbers may not be athletic enough to foreshadow a position change., PFA,," Baron is a try-hard three-technique who was a disruptive player for the Hokies this season, but who lacks the physical traits teams look for on draft day. There are times on tape where Baron looks like he might possess enough athleticism to give a move to 4-3 defensive end a shot, but his lack of length and explosiveness makes it a longshot."
Dylan Bradley,DT," Squatty, but powerful. Is always the low man and plays with combination of leverage and force. Strikes upward blows with strong hands and can lift blockers off the ground. Uses efficient route to blocker's frame with his hands. Able to hold up at point of attack and even two-gap if he lands his hands first. Had impressive tape against LSU. Played nose, three-technique and defensive end spots and had several reps where he tossed LSU guards and tight ends around like rag dolls. Plays with plus awareness and football intelligence. Recognizes down blocks quickly and attacks them early. Tenacious in his pursuit of the ball.", Short-stepper who is short and light. Can be enveloped by size. Must find ways to play on blocker's edge. Labors to counter his way past blockers once they get him centered. Likely unable to carry enough mass to be able to defend against double teams. Will need more developed pass rush plan with multiple moves. Doesn't have twitchy get-off to be a consistently disruptive penetrator. Lack of length hinders his pass rush. Unable to flip hips over the top of blockers. Lacks discipline. Has been flagged 19 times during his career., Round 6-7,," He doesn't have the quickness or height to play defensive end and he is much smaller than teams would like at defensive tackle, but Bradley's toughness, play strength, and body control should translate to the next level. While finding a fit for Bradley will be challenging and he may need to make a team as an undrafted free agent, he's a good football player and elements of his game are reminiscent of Grady Jarrett."
Tyrique Jarrett,NT, Wide body with pure girth. Able to challenge blockers with his size alone. Hardly a stiff on his feet. Displays some lateral movement and gives linemen a moving target when asked to participate in twists and stunts up front. Has enough man-on-man power to generate push up the middle when his pad level is right. Can dent the pocket as a bull-rusher., Pops up too tall after the snap. Frame is high-cut creating some instabilities with contact balance. Doesn't play with square pad level when taking on double teams. Needs to anchor and own the gaps. Delays in throwing his hands limiting his ability to control point of attack. Injured his leg and missed the final three games of the season. Never played in more than 44 percent of his team's defensive snaps while at Pitt., PFA,," Massive frame is begging to be used as a 0-technique nose who can plug up the interior against the run, but his pad level and high-cut frame create an inconsistent anchor when challenged by double teams. If he can play with better pad level and improve his hand usage to take full advantage of his size, he might be able to improve enough to create an opportunity for himself with a team that is looking for size."
Johnathan Calvin,DE," Possesses thick trunk and decent power in his lower half. Has played with a hand in the ground and standing. Comes off the snap with adequate upfield burst. Appears to have a better get-off with his hand in the ground. Uses stab move to help him gain advantage against tackle when rushing the passer. Puts some pepper in his punch and can jar blockers when he lands first. Has enough natural strength to play through contact and operate with heavier pads at contact. Plays with above average instincts. Will spot reverses, screens and throwbacks. Has experience dropping into zone coverage. Had two blocked kicks this season."," Short-stepper burdened by bundled hips. Straight-line, face-up rusher lacking hip flip and shoulder turn to slither over the edge. Takes extended vertical path beyond normal pass rush arc in order to help him gain enough ground to turn the corner. Counter move is needed back underneath. Has limited change of direction to chase and finish against darting running backs and scrambling quarterbacks in space.", PFA,," Calvin lacks the length and production to get scouts excited, but he might have the size and upfield burst to project to either defensive line in an even front or rush linebacker in an odd front. He's not a dynamic athlete and is unable to corner tightly as a pass rusher, but he has decent hands and could have enough initial explosion to generate some speed-to-power ability with more coaching. Appears to have more practice squad potential than roster potential at this point."
Samson Ebukam,OLB," Explosive athlete with a background in basketball, javelin and shot-put in high school. Triggers out of his stance with quick-twitch as a rusher. Attacks the edge with plus burst and has the desire to keep working when he gets punched and controlled early. Wowed teams with a vertical leap of 39 inches and a sub 4.5 forty yard dash at his pro day. Plays with a suddenness when crashing down the line after ball carriers. Drawn to the play like a magnet. Lauded for intelligence and work ethic. Initial quickness creates disruption in run game. Chalked up 15 tackles for loss and two forced fumbles in 2016. Rangy with a willingness to pursue way down the field.", Tends to play too frenetically at times. Will need to eliminate some of the wasted motion with his flailing arms and legs. Gets overly focused on blocker in front of him and will lose sight of ball carrier. Wins with raw athleticism over technique. Better hand usage must become a priority. Gets glued to blocks for too long and can be slow to disengage. One-speed pass rusher who doesn't generate as much speed to power as hoped. Lacks the size to play through redirect blocks. Needs to develop a more nuanced rush plan with workable counter moves for next level., Round 5, Bryan Braman," Ebukam is a driven prospect with above average intelligence who is still in the process of matching his skill to his athletic ability. He lacks desired size and power to play with his hand in the ground and will have to move to an outside linebacker spot. Ebukam has a chance to get drafted on the third day and his speed, explosiveness, and motor could make him a special teams standout while a team works to develop him as a pass rusher."
Phazahn Odom,TE," All-state basketball player in high school who averaged 19 points and 14 rebounds per game. Arms unfurl for days and check in right at 36 inches. Has the length to extend well beyond his frame and rescue throws well out in front of him on crossing routes. Plays with long, flexible strides as an open field runner after the catch. Possesses unique ability to hurdle over tacklers who try and go low. Long arms give defensive backs trouble when he's able to latch onto them as a blocker in space.", Passive blocker who shies away from the big collision when asked to come across formation and wham defensive ends. Will need substantial weight work to upgrade his play strength. Doesn't have the strength or ability to be an in-line blocking option. Can be easily rerouted by force. Is a little plodding into his routes and plays way too tall creating extended gear down before opening. Slaps at football rather than snatches it as a pass catcher., PFA,," Tall and exceptionally long, Odom has the length and athletic ability that will likely intrigue some teams. However, his lack of playing strength shows up in his routes and in his blocking. He may not have pass-catching or blocking strengths to make it in the league."
Alex Armah,FB, Durable and tough. Two-way player who was named all-conference first team defensive end and second team tight end. Thick through his chest and lower body carries good mass. Pumped out 26 bench reps. Has experience as in-line blocker against bigger foes. Has desired demeanor to be a blocker. Has athleticism in space and is a viable consideration as blocker/pass-catcher in two-back scheme., Will need much more experience as a lead blocker. Spent most of his time as a tight end and will have to learn to find targets in space and land a blow on them. Is a little too short to be considered for h-back or move tight end duties. Needs to bring his feet with him through contact for better block sustaining., PFA,," Armah has some talent to build on, but finding the right positional fit for him is the first challenge a team will face. Teams seem to be split on where to play him with some seeing outside linebacker, some seeing inside linebacker and some seeing him as a fullback. I see him as a lead blocker pairing with a zone-heavy team looking for some size and ability to catch the ball out of play-action."
Andreas Knappe,OT, Hulking frame with decent length. Raw but still improving. Plays with a cerebral nature and studies the game closely. Possesses good core strength as base blocker. Can seal his man on move blocks once he drives feet through their outside shoulder. Flashes good initial strength in his hands and has adequate sustain when block is in front of him. Shows an understanding of pocket depth and rarely over-sets behind the arc., Danish import who took the game up at the age of 18 and will turn 26 this June. Uses head-first approach into pass punch and waist-bending follows closely behind. Feet are a little plodding and his mirror is below average in protection. Not a natural bender. Straight-legged approach opens the door for bull rushers. Lack of desired foot quickness is an issue. Pad level on his 6-foot-8 frame will always ride too tall. Lack of leverage limits ability to drive defenders off their spots., Round 7-PFA,," Knappe is a two-year starter who has the size and intelligence that will appeal to NFL offensive line coaches, but his lack of plus athleticism and below average knee bend will make handling NFL edge players extremely difficult. While teams are generally willing to stash raw, but improving talents like Knappe, his age is likely to factor against him in that regard."
Breon Borders,CB, Three-year starter who has posted tremendous ball production at Duke. Plays with quality pattern recognition and jumps the route hard once he reads it. Isn't satisfied unless he is swiping at and disrupting a catch. Good leaper who times his jumps. Has had 26 passes defensed over last two seasons and 12 interceptions during his career. Plays with quality instincts inside his coverage. Has a feel for angles and uses it to undercut routes. Willing to step downhill quickly when it is time to support the run., Gets too upright and narrow from his backpedal when asked to flip his hips in transition. Slow to mash the gas and accelerate after receivers beat him from press coverage. Allows vertical separation leading to big plays. Allowed high numbers in yardage per catch throughout his career. Missing instant twitch to match routes out of their breaks. Desire to make plays causes him to lag behind deep coverage if he sees a bait route drifting into his coverage area. Doesn't carry much force as a tackler., Round 7-PFA,, Borders' ball production and completion percentage against over the last two seasons (38.3 percent in 2016 and 42 percent in 2015) are indicative of his instincts and ball skills. Borders chances as an NFL cornerback could be dampened by his inability to carry long speed down the field. He's a late-round pick or undrafted free agent who is best suited in off-man or zone coverage.
D'Nerius Antoine,S, Carries an NFL frame with the body type to fit in the box. Flies into the play with reckless abandon. Makes decent reads on route breaks and attacks hard to the catch point when he triggers. Has experience as a punt and kick returner and finished with 10 special teams tackles in 2015. Averaged 20 yards per punt return in junior college and played on the basketball team., Only managed 10 bench press reps despite above average safety build. Inconsistent tackler who appeared more worried with landing an impact blow rather than wrapping up. Allowed a high number of missed and broken tackles over the last two seasons. Feet tend to deaden at impact rather than driving through. Lacks discipline in coverage. Allows eyes to linger in the backfield and play-action can suck him up and out of place in coverage., PFA,," Antoine lacks the coverage talent to be considered a full-time safety, but his experience as a return man combined with his ability to get down the field in kick coverage gives him an outside shot of finding his way on a roster as a special teams specialist."
Devante Mays,RB," Built like a truck with muscular legs and a powerful, broad chest. Has a 420-pound bench press to his name. Physical runner with a penchant for finishing with a bowed neck and heavy pads. Looks to accelerate through contact and can create additional yardage with his power through contact. Patient runner willing to follow lead blockers and accelerate when the time is right. Has adequate speed to threaten to the edges and force linebackers to flow hard. Fluid hips and light feet for a back his size. Praised by teammates and coaches for attitude and work ethic.", Recurring leg injury robbed him of all but 37 carries this season. Feet aren't always agreeable with his eyes and will get sticky when faced with traffic leaking into the backfield. Vision is inconsistent and he will leave yardage on the field. Appears to lack confidence in some running lanes and tends to scan for larger points of entry. Will need to expedite his processing and be willing to commit to a lane earlier. Had just two career catches at Utah State. Likely an early-down back only., Round 7-PFA,," After a monstrous performance early in the season against Weber State, Mays was never able to get completely right after injuring his ankle against USC. While he may have slid off of radars after the season, his 4.5-second 40-yard dash and 40.5-inch vertical leap were likely a wake-up call for evaluators who could be intrigued by his size, power and explosiveness. Mays has the physical tools to find his way into a camp and battle for a spot at the back end of the running back depth chart."
Jason Croom,TE," Has desired size-to-speed ratio. Ran a 4.69 40-yard dash at his pro day. Posted athletic, explosive totals in areas of his testing. Gets out of his breaks with plus acceleration to open throwing windows. Flexible with ability to sink and dig poor throws off of his shoelaces. Hands catcher who made tough catches in traffic against Vanderbilt. Good open field athlete. Has the speed and athleticism to add yardage after the catch and attack the seam. Uses controlled steps into targets as a blocker. Has some conviction in his run-blocking and could see improvement with more coaching. Has frame to be an NFL in-line option.", Short-stepper into his routes. Routes tend to be upright with some tightness in his strides. Lacks sharpness out of his breaks. Needs to do a better job of taking care of his quarterbacks. Will drift in his routes allowing defenders angles to make plays on the ball. Needs to keep opponents on his hip. Doesn't always play as strong or as fast as he should inside his routes. Focus drops are a legitimate issue. Has seven career drops to just 60 catches. Had a focus drop against Alabama and dropped a sure touchdown against Florida this year., Round 7-PFA,," Croom missed most of 2012 and all of 2015 due to injuries so his medical examinations will be important. Came into Tennessee as a big receiver and has grown into an NFL frame. Croom's size and speed give him a shot to be taken on the third day, but continuing to improve as a run blocker is going to be the key to making a team."
Jason Thompson,S," Good size with great speed. Explosive testing was off the charts at his pro day. Posted a 39.5-inch vertical jump and 11-foot, 1-inch broad jump with a very good three-cone drill. Team captain with an unselfish approach to the game and a cranked motor that makes him a favorite of the coaches. Voracious note taker who wants to learn and loves football. Special teams ace who races ahead of teammates to find the ball. Had 17 special teams tackles total over last two seasons.", Former quarterback at Wyoming who transferred in and has never had a bankable position fit. Has almost no production as a defensive player. Will have to prove he has some roster value other than special teams specialist. Plays too upright in space which limits change of direction on punt return coverage. Learning safety position will take time., PFA,," Special teams cover specialists can find a place in the NFL, but they generally need to have some positional value attached to them as well and Thompson isn't there yet. His football character and athletic traits are both on the high end so he could have a shot at making a practice squad as an undrafted free agent and developmental project with a future on special teams."
Kyle Sloter,QB," Needs more weight on his frame, but has size needed to see over his offensive line. Has been working with former NFL offensive coordinator Steve Fairchild to improve his delivery and mechanics. Has experience under center and in a play-action offense from pistol set. Appears to be comfortable throwing on the move and has the arm talent to make throws from a variety of arm slots. Throws with plus drive velocity when it's time to rip it into a window. Quick-footed athlete who is able to elude pocket pressure and hurt teams with his legs.", Still extremely raw. Has just one season of quarterback experience under his belt. Doesn't have experience necessary to throw with desired timing and anticipation at this point. Looks for open man rather than developing windows. Footwork can become an absolute mess in the pocket. Will throw with front side flying wide open at times. Inconsistent ball placement plagues him with crossing routes. Leaves wide receivers in a holding pattern with some of his underthrows on deep shots. Ball doesn't come out on time frequently enough., PFA,," Sloter is a transfer from Southern Miss who has gone from quarterback to receiver and back to quarterback. He has good size and a lively arm, but only has 320 career passing attempts under his belt. However, he flashed enough raw potential as a senior that he has garnered NFL attention and has an outside shot of sneaking into the final day. Sloter is a project that will almost certainly require a couple of years on a practice squad."
LeShun Daniels,RB, Showed off his durability and toughness this season. Adequate finisher who has the lower body power to grind the pile and move the sticks. Averaged 2.4 yards after contact keeping his legs churning forward. Kept a consistent track when running outside zone and was willing to keep runs play-side despite suspect play speed., Too tight to wiggle. Straight-liner who will struggle to get out of the way of his own hips and avoid oncoming traffic. Shows hesitation with inside zone runs. Takes awhile to see the hole develop. Lacks play speed to create a hard flow from linebackers. Dink and dunk option in passing game and has little value in that area., PFA,," Big back with good toughness, but limited by his inability to create for himself. Daniels lacks the NFL burst teams are looking for between the tackles and offers almost no value as a third-down back. He should get a sniff as an undrafted free agent but could be a longshot to make a roster."
Malik Golden,S, Shows an ability to diagnose run quickly. Attacks downhill after reading run and looks to make tackles as close to the line of scrimmage as possible. Plays with a plus burst to close out running backs looking for the corner. Is comfortable playing near the box. Digests route combinations easily and comes out of the other side sticking to his assignment., Needs more discipline in his run support. Will lose leverage when pursuing running backs allowing cutback lanes. Tackling is an issue. Early head-ducker into tackles and doesn't always see what he's hitting. Missed on 17 tackles last season. Posted disappointing ball production totals at Penn State. Not a natural playmaker. Plays the man over seeking opportunities to attack the throw., PFA,," Golden has decent size and good speed, but he lacks the fundamental tackling to make a living near the line of scrimmage and his lack of plays on the ball makes a projection as a deep safety difficult."
Matt Wogan,K, Kickoff specialist who has handled that duty for four years at Oregon. Has a booming leg that has planted over 65 percent of his kickoffs for touchbacks over the last two seasons., Inconsistent field goal kicker his first two seasons. Eventually lost his starting job. May not have the talent to handle field goal duties on NFL level. Needs improved hang time for directional kickoffs., PFA,," He does one thing but does it well. Wogan focused on becoming a kick-off specialist two years ago and he does a good job of banging it out of the end zone. While he's good at his specialty, he's still a long shot because he lacks production as a field goal kicker."
Tre'Von Johnson,LB, Active and tough. Tenacious defender who finds his way to the football. Three-year starter who finished career with 258 tackles including 27 for losses. Named team captain his junior and senior seasons. Has experience at inside and outside linebacker spots. Good straight-line speed to chase from sideline to sideline. Will clean up shallow crossers looking for a free ride in his coverage area. Heads-up hitter who fires into his target with good aggression., Sluggish in his stop-start movements. Center of gravity is a little high which limits his change of direction quickness. Reactive athleticism is just average. He could struggle as an open field tackler against runners with wiggle. Explosion testing numbers for his pro day fell below the NFL norm for his size. Needs to maintain a base width to prevent getting jostled around at point of attack. Needs more authoritative punch to keep himself clean and avoid getting locked up by blockers., PFA,, Productive team leader with good straight-line speed and an aggressive on-field demeanor. Johnson is a little undersized for the interior and will likely be shuttled to an outside linebacker spot. He has good straight-line speed though his reactive athleticism could limit his draft grade. Johnson will likely be an undrafted free agent who needs to make a name for himself on special teams.
